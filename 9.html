<h3> NobleLife </h3> <br/><div> My username would be NobleLife<br><br>I would like to be a beta-tester/debugger because similar to @scratchieguy12345678 , I am very good at finding little bugs and small mistakes.<br><br>For proof I would fix my sisters Super Mario Maker levels when there was a small bug in it <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__020d0ae5849c11b9c1bb810a45234689__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/tongue.png">. I also have a recommendation, I think you should use a blacklist rather than preset phrases. Unless there are thousands of them, then it may start getting dull depending on if this blows up or not.<br><br>By the way, when I say blacklist, the project should encode the text into hexadecimal (or any other encoding), and check for swear words in the hexadecimal state. And it shouldn't allow comments under 3 letters long (outside hex).<br><br>If you don't like the idea of a blacklist, then instead of preset sentences, you should have preset words that you can merge into a sentence.<br><br>Here's a simple showcase of how this might be able to work.<br>—————————————————————————————————————————————————————<br>You are able to use these words in your message: hello, how, are, am, you, today, you, O.K, I.<br><br>And using those words, you can make sentences like “hello how are you today”, “are you O.K” or “I am O.K”.<br>—————————————————————————————————————————————————————<br>If you still think that preset phrases are the best way to go, then that's okay. I am only recommending this cause I think it's a good idea. If you disagree, then I'm totally fine with it, as long as you don't attack me about it (which I highly doubt you will).<br><br><pre class="blocks">when green flag clicked<br>move (10) steps</pre> </div><hr \><h3> CST1229 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">NobleLife wrote:</p>You are able to use these words in your message: hello, how, are, am, you, today, you, O.K, I.</blockquote>A whitelist of words are still not allowed according to Scratch.
