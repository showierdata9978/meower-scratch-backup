EXPECT SERVER RESTARTS.</blockquote><br>Wrong, this is apparently a glitch in the client's networking scripts. I think I know how to fix it. Sometimes requests are returned way too fast, and the networking code currently doesn't check the packet queue. I'll look into it. Also, this far the server hasn't crashed or been brought down without my knowing (all the other times it has is when I was working on it).<br><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">qrcool wrote:</p>The new post and log out buttons are the only top menu ones that work for me.</blockquote>That's intentional.
