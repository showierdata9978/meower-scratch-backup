The latest build will be forked and converted into Yoom, and we will remove CloudLink in favor of Scratch's cloud variables to finish Meower.<br><br>For those not aware, Yoom is a project I created before the conception of Meower. Yoom was created in the early days of the Scratch 3.0 era, before the ban on whitelist-based chats. Development was put on hiatus when the new rules on cloud variables were announced. Then Meower came along. Long story short, Yoom is now Meower's sister project and will serve as a testing ground for new, experimental features (Including, but not limited to, custom user profile photos), as well as reviving the much-preferred whitelist-based chat system. I plan on continuing the development of both projects equally.<br><br>If you would like, <a href="https://github.com/the-yoom-project">please join The Yoom Project on GitHub.</a> As for those who would prefer to finish Meower, please continue to follow and contribute to this thread.

If so then we need someone to set that up. anyways. Let me just think out loud. We need to store several things. All the account settings:which can be represented by numbers. The password for which I'll hook up a hashing system.  The account username that will go with those things. so when signing up we will need someone to enter a username and password. for example @-cloudgate- and “password” as the password.  If I set meower to blue theme and put it on light mode I would get the following for the “settings” part of the savecode(if everything else was on default):  111012.  The word “password” will be encrypted with a key(your password) and the result will be hashed string, such as “0a910b111213c1415d1617efgh18i19j20212223klm2425nopq26272829rst3031uvwxyz3233AB3435C3637DE3839FGHI4041JK424344LM45N4647O48P49Q50R51525354S” if your password is “password”.

I will provide hosting services, with repl as a failover. As of now, we'll stick to Repl, but in the future, I'd like to provide the hosting services. I'll provide secure access to all moderators in the future for moderation purposes. <br><br>2. Why not use ACE? (Advanced Cryptography Engine) It's an old project but it gets the job done for crudely hashing strings. Very easy to use. <span class="bb-strikethrough">I'm thinking of writing a new extension that is a JS-port of ACE</span><br><br>3. For Scratch, we should only use the username block for verification (sharing passwords, even if it's hashed, is a big no-no on Scratch). As for the non-Scratch version, authentication services should be provided by CloudAccount, either through legacy login (comparing SHA-256 hashes) or through 2FA (Still need to get this working). Only reason why we should try to use CA is because I already have the backend present and it would take longer to develop a new backend for this purpose alone…<br><br>3. User settings are stored in a global list (I think it was called “USERDATA”), which can be concatenated/de-concatenated to/from a string for encoding/decoding over the cloud variable link.<br><br>4. I think this 4-file system is elegant. We'll see what we can do about it. As for file storage, we'll leave it to repl files for now, but in the future, I'll see if I can host it on my NAS for easier scaling in the future (I have a spare 2ish terabytes to play with, we should be good for a while)</blockquote><br>1. ok, but we'd need to rebuild the engine on repl or whatever you're hosting with. It'd have to read the cloud vars. decode them. Turn them into file system commands. And finally provide responses. It's d have to store the “files”(list items) in a similar way to the cloud engine. <br><br>2. I think I already have a fairly good engine( <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/98933521/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/98933521/</a> )<br><br>3.
