I feel like this could be the logo for the Meower wiki. </div><hr \><h3> johnelr </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">johnelr wrote:</p><img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/memers_mc_beamers/826Untitled.png"><br>heres a mascot i made in ms paint<br>imagine if you had your own as a profile picture<br>and you could customize it</blockquote>bump </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> I made a modified version of the meower logo using Adobe Illustrator.

This feature will only be included in Yoom, since we don't have harsh bandwidth limits and the ST on our tails.<br><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">TheStrykerJay wrote:</p>Just wanted to inform all of you that it is me, (cant say old username).
