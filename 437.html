<h3> JoshAtticus </h3> <br/><div> Enough off-topic talks!!!!!!!

I can’t get the disc chat, GitHub’s system is weird… let’s make a separate Meower client for devs to talk freely </div><hr \><h3> meguy7878 </h3> <br/><div> Besides off topic, telling people to stop saying stuff is off topic, so if someone posts something off topic, it’s best to just let one person inform them of the bypass of our rules. If multiple people spam issues of people saying off topic stuff, even more off topic posts about off topic posts will appear and it will continue on until our forum gets shut down again and it will start to dawn on us that our posts are clogging up our forum in a very avoidable way. Starting now, I should expect that our members keep the forum in a serious state. Use our external communication lines to talk more freely, if you need to. If you can’t, try changing up your post to be more related to us. Stick to our topic, Meowers, it’s the reason our unity exists. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> you know what<br><br>forget what I said about my break<br><br>I'm gonna work on Meower anyway because I'm bored </div><hr \><h3> Galaxymaster79 </h3> <br/><div> <span class="bb-big">hi whats up </span> im not a worker btw </div><hr \><h3> --Velocity-- </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">meguy7878 wrote:</p>Besides off topic, telling people to stop saying stuff is off topic, so if someone posts something off topic, it’s best to just let one person inform them of the bypass of our rules.
