If so then we need someone to set that up. anyways. Let me just think out loud. We need to store several things. All the account settings:which can be represented by numbers. The password for which I'll hook up a hashing system.  The account username that will go with those things. so when signing up we will need someone to enter a username and password. for example @-cloudgate- and “password” as the password.  If I set meower to blue theme and put it on light mode I would get the following for the “settings” part of the savecode(if everything else was on default):  111012.  The word “password” will be encrypted with a key(your password) and the result will be hashed string, such as “0a910b111213c1415d1617efgh18i19j20212223klm2425nopq26272829rst3031uvwxyz3233AB3435C3637DE3839FGHI4041JK424344LM45N4647O48P49Q50R51525354S” if your password is “password”. The complete save code will be sent in 2 parts(it will take 1 second to be sent with my engine)<br><br><span class="bb-bold">1.</span>111012<br><span class="bb-bold">2.</span>0a910b111213c1415d1617efgh18i19j20212223klm2425nopq26272829rst3031uvwxyz3233AB3435C3637DE3839FGHI4041JK424344LM45N4647O48P49Q50R51525354S<br><br>Once sent both will go to a folder(in the storage engine) called users/-CloudGate-/settings<br>and users/-CloudGate-/password respectively <br><br>For signing in you will enter your username and password. <br>It will check for /users/-CloudGate-/password.<br>if it exists, then it will encrypt “password” with your password.

I will provide hosting services, with repl as a failover. As of now, we'll stick to Repl, but in the future, I'd like to provide the hosting services. I'll provide secure access to all moderators in the future for moderation purposes. <br><br>2. Why not use ACE? (Advanced Cryptography Engine) It's an old project but it gets the job done for crudely hashing strings. Very easy to use. <span class="bb-strikethrough">I'm thinking of writing a new extension that is a JS-port of ACE</span><br><br>3. For Scratch, we should only use the username block for verification (sharing passwords, even if it's hashed, is a big no-no on Scratch). As for the non-Scratch version, authentication services should be provided by CloudAccount, either through legacy login (comparing SHA-256 hashes) or through 2FA (Still need to get this working). Only reason why we should try to use CA is because I already have the backend present and it would take longer to develop a new backend for this purpose alone…<br><br>3. User settings are stored in a global list (I think it was called “USERDATA”), which can be concatenated/de-concatenated to/from a string for encoding/decoding over the cloud variable link.<br><br>4. I think this 4-file system is elegant. We'll see what we can do about it. As for file storage, we'll leave it to repl files for now, but in the future, I'll see if I can host it on my NAS for easier scaling in the future (I have a spare 2ish terabytes to play with, we should be good for a while)</blockquote><br>1. ok, but we'd need to rebuild the engine on repl or whatever you're hosting with. It'd have to read the cloud vars. decode them. Turn them into file system commands. And finally provide responses. It's d have to store the “files”(list items) in a similar way to the cloud engine. <br><br>2. I think I already have a fairly good engine( <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/98933521/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/98933521/</a> )<br><br>3. I figured that out already<br><br>4.IDK how you're going to store files, but this is the engine I'm using to store them  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/411713017/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/411713017/</a><br><br><br></blockquote>This confuzzles me </div><hr \><h3> silvxrcat </h3> <br/><div> save my username for me please lol<br> </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">silvxrcat wrote:</p>save my username for me please lol<br></blockquote><br>When we're alive, I'll reserve usernames. </div><hr \><h3> Pixelation-Creations </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">silvxrcat wrote:</p>save my username for me please lol<br></blockquote><br>When we're alive, I'll reserve usernames.</blockquote>can u reserve PIXEL for me? </div><hr \><h3> markverb1 </h3> <br/><div> reserve markverb1 </div><hr \><h3> ToastersUnited </h3> <br/><div> Reserve Toasty </div><hr \><h3> RoboStudiosGames </h3> <br/><div> Reservere Hippo please <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__76aae98b0efe7ce285628707fbd6f409__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/smile.png"> </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Pixelation-Creations wrote:</p>can u reserve PIXEL for me?</blockquote><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">markverb1 wrote:</p>reserve markverb1</blockquote><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">ToastersUnited wrote:</p>Reserve Toasty</blockquote><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">RoboStudiosGames wrote:</p>Reservere Hippo please <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__76aae98b0efe7ce285628707fbd6f409__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/smile.png"></blockquote><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><span class="bb-big"><span class="bb-bold">When we're alive</span></span>, I'll reserve usernames.</blockquote> </div><hr \><h3> zedthehedgehog </h3> <br/><div> <span class="bb-small">reserve zedthehedgehog</span> </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">zedthehedgehog wrote:</p><span class="bb-small">reserve zedthehedgehog</span></blockquote><br>I'm gonna say this one last time.<br><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><span class="bb-big"><span class="bb-bold"><span style="color:red">When we're alive</span></span></span>, I'll reserve usernames.</blockquote> </div><hr \><a href="/?p=277"> Next page </a>
