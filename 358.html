If I were to make it a proper legal entity, I'd establish it as its sole proprietor. But we aren't anything at all. We're just a bunch of random people online who came together to make an unprofessional project. And I would really prefer if we keep it more chillaxed. But when legalities need to be followed, we should do so.<br><br>regarding our current situation about privacy and data collection perhaps I should make a new policy on a more collaboration-friendly platform, as per say, hackmd?<br><br>as of now, I could use some help, and in all honesty, I'm just about ready to give Meower (Scratch-release version) the axe. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> I have temporarily removed our legal section from the front page as it's imperative to revise it.<br><br>I have created an outline of what we need to discuss and convert into legal documentation here:<br><br><div class="code"><pre>https://hackmd.io/@MikeDEV/B1kln7XLt</pre></div><br>Anyone and everyone are welcome to provide feedback/make suggestions to our legal section.

I would like to keep Meower secure by design.<br><br>Since Meower will depend on CloudLink Suite, CloudLink itself will need to depend upon the security of both CloudAccount and CloudDisk. My biggest improvement from old CloudLink is the implementation of 2-Factor Authentication, as well as OTSKs (One-Time Session Keys), which are special token keys that can only be used for one logged in user, and can be used to authenticate other services (which in this case, CloudDisk). <br><br>My biggest concern regarding security is obvious stupidity on my part. One obvious security note is to keep the Meower server IP private, and purged from source code, and only stored (with very good obfuscation) in compiled binaries/HTML files. I'm also considering implementing a new security feature for CloudLink servers, and that is Trusted Access keys. these keys can be generated on the server-side and can be stored in a project as a variable. Ideally, you would compile the project and have the project send that code to the server to verify access, and purge the variable's data when distributing open-source code. Think of it as something similar to SSL. </div><hr \><a href="/360.html"> Next page </a>
