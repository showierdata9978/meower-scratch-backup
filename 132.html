That also includes new Scratchers… As far as I know, there's not really a way to prevent this because there's no way to authenticate cloud requests.</blockquote>There isn't a way to, so we can't quite control what is being randomly put in the database, but what we can do is make sure that messages against the community guidelines are not displayed. That can be done by keeping a local copy of all the permitted combinations and checking if the combinations match. Also, I was thinking, since we already have such a list, why not the cloud only store which item on the combination list it is? That way, even if our database got edited, no matter what they input, it will end up displaying a permitted combination. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">BlockPoint wrote:</p>Maybe summer vacation or school</blockquote><br>Wrong and wrong.<br><br>I just got into a bit of a schedule conflict… Again.<br><br>Gotta love your parents. </div><hr \><h3> AUmaker08 </h3> <br/><div> this is absolutely amazing<br>just the preview amazed me<br>i cant wait for the full version to release! </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">BlockPoint wrote:</p>Maybe summer vacation or school</blockquote><br>Wrong and wrong.<br><br>I just got into a bit of a schedule conflict… Again.<br><br>Gotta love your parents.</blockquote>can you make another forum for the tos? </div><hr \><h3> The_Agent_J </h3> <br/><div> I seriously can't wait!  </div><hr \><h3> IceCreamTub </h3> <br/><div> Poggers </div><hr \><a href="/134.html"> Next page </a>
