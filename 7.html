This project seems to do just that. I am currently doing a cloud level editor for Puzzleing, the servers are going great, the editor itself isn't. Lol.<br>Reasons we should pick you: I am a web developer on ASP.net framework. I have loads of experience with servers, maybe not Scatch ones done on cloud variables, but it can be done. For now, I am thinking of encoding all the post info into a int, then tag it to a page address. When you visit a page, the program will look through the server for the address and take the information after.</blockquote><br>You'll need to get in contact with @-CloudGate- for info about how we're doing cloud vars… As for your application, you're on the team!</blockquote>Ah, ok. Actually, since we haven't released it yet, changing the generally way we format the variable is relatively easy. But I'll just ask him, my way needn't be the best way on Scratch, because well… I have less language specific experience.  </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> how do we attach all cloud vars to a server not in scratch, the only why i know how to do that is via htmlifier. </div><hr \><h3> Dotumantaraye </h3> <br/><div> Username: Dotumantaraye <br>Wanted job: Debugger/Play Tester<br>Reason for wanting this job: It's the only job that I can take, contribute much and do a decent job.
