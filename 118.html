By the way, modifying the project will disable cloud variables, which negates 90% of our problems. We must use a pre-created list of approved phrases since whitelists alone aren't allowed and blacklists are also banned. meguy7878 has a point:<br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">meguy7878 wrote:</p>That could crash Scratch, or even break the servers and HTML that it runs on, I don't think he would do that… ya not happening.

Security updates will be added as necessary. As for major overhauls, they will be yearly.<br><br><br><br>Also, I forgot to mention, the phrase database should be hashed, and the latest DB hash should be stored in another cloud variable, and whenever the project is updated with a newer DB the hash should be updated as well, and instances of the project using an out of date hash will be required to refresh. </div><hr \><h3> The_Agent_J </h3> <br/><div> Would this crash low-end computers (Example: School chromebook) like Codebreakers (A really good scratch platformer fighter like SSBU.) did unintentionaly?
