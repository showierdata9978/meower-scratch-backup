Thank you for the access. </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> im gonna continue on the sprite based ui. </div><hr \><h3> -ThinkArtTV- </h3> <br/><div> Before the designing begins, I've been studying about the GUI Interface in the Preview you posted. I've studied about the mood it's supposed to give you, and the characteristics. I understand that Art is what pulls a viewer into the project. I have full dedication on this project, and I will finish what I have started. I will furthermore learn about the GUI, and understand how it takes someone's attention. Once I'm done I'll get started. It would be helpful on what specifically I should design for the project!
