(please don't spam people as that would be rude and ruin Meower's reputation)<br><br><span class="bb-italic">PROGRAMMERS/CLOUD/SERVERS:</span> Send links to demos about the cloud engine. We will need to thoroughly test it before our initial release.<br><br><span class="bb-italic">PLAYTESTERS/DEBUGGERS:</span> Please test demos sent from the programmers. I will also need testers to <a href="https://turbowarp.org/468221502?fps=60&amp;hqpen">check this demo</a> for any bugs (note that there is a high chance of such since I'm actively working on it, little by little).<br><br><span class="bb-italic">MUSICIANS/COMPOSERS:</span> Create AT LEAST ONE Background Music track for Meower. Our aesthetic I'd hope for us to achieve is similar to the Wii U System OST… <a href="/discuss/youtube/yL8H0eqrvcQ/">See this for reference of the vibe</a>. Send links to completed works prior to May 28 and we'll all have a vote on which track is the best.

Any other skills applicable (such as art, music, etc.) should be used to assist the aforementioned. If not applicable, simply relax. Currently, the only assistance needed from human moderators is to manage spam and/or handle bug reports, so feel free to compile a list of all possible cases that you can think of, and we'll create a FAQ for bug reports.<br><br><span class="bb-italic">DESIGNERS:</span> As mentioned for the Moderators, any skills applicable (such as art, music, etc.) should be used to assist others. For now, you don't have any other jobs to handle.<br><br><span class="bb-italic"><span class="bb-bold">FOR ALL MEMBERS:</span></span> To keep our project running, I'd like everyone to check in with the forum <span class="bb-bold"><span class="bb-underline">at least once a week</span></span>, simply posting something like “checking in”. I'd like to keep consistency with the attendance of members and keep track of activity. This rule will begin enforcement on April 30, 2021, at 12:00 PM EST.<br><br>As for myself, I will continue to manage the forums, (try to) work on the front end, and get the final OK from ST for any pending, serious questions.<br>Good luck everyone!

The latest build will be forked and converted into Yoom, and we will remove CloudLink in favor of Scratch's cloud variables to finish Meower.<br><br>For those not aware, Yoom is a project I created before the conception of Meower. Yoom was created in the early days of the Scratch 3.0 era, before the ban on whitelist-based chats. Development was put on hiatus when the new rules on cloud variables were announced. Then Meower came along. Long story short, Yoom is now Meower's sister project and will serve as a testing ground for new, experimental features (Including, but not limited to, custom user profile photos), as well as reviving the much-preferred whitelist-based chat system. I plan on continuing the development of both projects equally.<br><br>If you would like, <a href="https://github.com/the-yoom-project">please join The Yoom Project on GitHub.</a> As for those who would prefer to finish Meower, please continue to follow and contribute to this thread. Thank you.</blockquote></li></ul></blockquote></blockquote><br>umm thats NOT ALLOWED (see The Official List Of Rejected Suggestions) </div><hr \><a href="/300.html"> Next page </a>
