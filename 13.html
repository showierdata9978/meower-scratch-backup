Maybe, you can write whatever you want, but before your comment is posted, a moderator views your comment (before posting it) to see what it says. I guess this would have to make moderators 13+ or something cause it may result in the moderators potentially seeing swear words, but applying a chat blacklist for the mods to see, and then checking weather it is good or not would be the best option. But if this is not allowed then that's okay.<br><br> I think that if a moderator is viewing the comment, then permitting it to be seen (if it's ok) isn't allowed on scratch, then a phase generator is the best option (if it's allowed on scratch).<br><br>(also, I didn't notice I accidentally re-worded a whitelist, my bad :lol<img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__020d0ae5849c11b9c1bb810a45234689__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/smile.png"></blockquote><br>… also not allowed <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__020d0ae5849c11b9c1bb810a45234689__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/sad.png"></blockquote>aw man, thought I had a strike of genius there lol<br><br>also, when can I beta test the project? </div><hr \><h3> Dotumantaraye </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">NobleLife wrote:</p>also, when can I beta test the project?</blockquote>The release date for the alpha version is around this summer. </div><hr \><h3> trappist-1e </h3> <br/><div> I have an idea for the chat system with predefined words: Let's say someone wants to write “I love science” But it doesn't have the word science, but it has a list of emojis with varied themes, including an emoji that represents science. </div><hr \><h3> NobleLife </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Dotumantaraye wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">NobleLife wrote:</p>also, when can I beta test the project?</blockquote>The release date for the alpha version is around this summer.</blockquote>epic <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__020d0ae5849c11b9c1bb810a45234689__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/tongue.png"> </div><hr \><h3> scratchieguy12345678 </h3> <br/><div> Why is this under the Unlicensed license?
