<h3> PixelWaasFound </h3> <br/><div> Just gonna suggest setting up a 16:9 aspect ratio. it would really improve the overall user experience.<br>unless the beta already has it, try to setup mobile support with an on-screen keyboard. <br>maybe add likes to posts?<br>also maybe try and design a mobile app with turbowarp packager and exe-to-apk converters for Android apps.<br>if anyone on the dev team is over 18, try putting it up on the app store for better visibility. wouldn't recommend the apple app store or even an apple app at all as you would have to rebuild it from the ground up in Xcode, then pay 100$USD a year for it to be on the app store. a pc app would be nice but not as important as Android apps i would say as pcs and macs can still go to app.meower.org to access meower.
