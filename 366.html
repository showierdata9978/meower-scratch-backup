Good grief. Bit of a TL;DR of what went down: Religious retreat with 99.9% of lecturing (!fun), afterward I ran a MoCA cable to my workstation so yay (WiFi being WiFi, hardwired internet is the way to go).<br><br>Perhaps a universal sentiment that we should all share here on out is that we are to not create off-topic posts. Scratch's gotten a lot riskier for my consideration for distribution.<br><br>Because of the current circumstances, I leave open the suggestion to completely abandon Scratch for distribution and go entirely self-hosted. Our current development will remain the same, the same source code, but we will be publishing the project all on our own (which we are more than well equipped for doing so). I would appreciate your feedback.<br><br>Stay safe out there, meowers.</blockquote> </div><hr \><h3> JoshAtticus </h3> <br/><div> Hooray!
