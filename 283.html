The latest build will be forked and converted into Yoom, and we will remove CloudLink in favor of Scratch's cloud variables to finish Meower.<br><br>For those not aware, Yoom is a project I created before the conception of Meower. Yoom was created in the early days of the Scratch 3.0 era, before the ban on whitelist-based chats. Development was put on hiatus when the new rules on cloud variables were announced. Then Meower came along. Long story short, Yoom is now Meower's sister project and will serve as a testing ground for new, experimental features (Including, but not limited to, custom user profile photos), as well as reviving the much-preferred whitelist-based chat system. I plan on continuing the development of both projects equally.<br><br>If you would like, <a href="https://github.com/the-yoom-project">please join The Yoom Project on GitHub.</a> As for those who would prefer to finish Meower, please continue to follow and contribute to this thread. Thank you. </div><hr \><a href="/meower-scratch-backup/285.html"> Next page </a>
