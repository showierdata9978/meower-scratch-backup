The way that I understand what you are saying is that meower will store data on project instances temporarily and will back them through cloud and scratch2pi for long storage when needed or sth, but I may understand it completly wrong. Also, can't wait for meower for native scratch.<br>Although seeing yoom working with cloudlink would also be interesting. </div><hr \><h3> CST1229 </h3> <br/><div> Bumping this (Oops, might be too fast.
