I wrote a bot that takes advantage of GitHub and Ngrok, so now I have a way to ab-“use” GitHub pages. Every time I run my bot, it opens a ngrok tunnel and updates a GitHub page with the most up-to-date ngrok IP, which can be fetched by a project. Pretty cool! This feature will be called “Dynamic CloudLink URLs”.<br><br>2. I implemented a download cache feature for quicker homepage loading. Also, the homepage will now appear instantly and continuously listen for new posts (after downloading the latest posts for the day).<br><br>3. I finally figured out how to GitHub Desktop. Horray. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> Meower source code has been updated to 4.5.1.<br><br>Changelog:<br>1. Implement Dynamic CloudLink URLs<br>2. Post download caching<br>3.
