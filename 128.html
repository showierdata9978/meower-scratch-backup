The problem is that we don't have enough of them, and there isn't any code for embedding in-line images within containers.

Could you explain in detail how it works, @-CloudGate-?</blockquote>I should explain it since I haven't done so in detail other than the time that a scratch bug deleted everything. It works by integrating two parts. A storage system and a P2P system. The P2P system is based off of dataduct and works by encoding messages into numbers. that data is set to a cloud variable along with encoded info about where it's meant to be sent. The other instances of the project can detect that the message is sent to them. They receive the message and clear that cloud variable to indicate that it's been sent. If the user it was supposed to send it to is not there then it will automatically clear the request from the cloud and says that something has gone wrong. If the message is too long to sent in one message then it's split into parts that go one by one. Multiple messages can be sent at once depending on how many cloud vars there are that are hooked up to this system. The storage side based off of siphon can write,delete,fetch and and to other things to a list. You can do any of those commands remotely by sending messages through the cloud. Ask if you have more questions. </div><hr \><h3> NILL_GAMES10 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">-CloudGate- wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>-snip-<br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">bloctans_4 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>mini update: small bug fix.<br><br>At this point, Meower's sister project, Yoom, is now ready.
