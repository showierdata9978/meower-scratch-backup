Mine is usually animated, but for some reason it’s just broken and I can’t fix it (._.) Is there some way Meower could just pull stuff from a database, instead of storing it locally?

We're pushing up to 50mb in size now and it's starting to show it's bloat. A large majority of it's from music files, which we would love to pull from a database instead, but we currently don't have the technology to do so at this time in vanilla. We are working on it.<br><br>Also, the reason why everything's been so quiet is because I've been busy working on Meower. And, I've been getting ready to abandon the scratch website. After meower leaves beta, I'm officially leaving. I'll continue working on Meower, but I will cease using the forums. If anyone wants to volunteer to keep this forum thread active when the time comes, let me know (this is currently not open yet, as we're still not even done).</blockquote>You're going to leave Meower when it goes out of beta? </blockquote>I think he means he's going to leave the scratch website. </div><hr \><h3> Marc92020 </h3> <br/><div> can we stop the drama about “bullies” and leaving scratch<br>the topic is going to get closed<br>and besides, nobody is bullying anybody </div><hr \><h3> DaCatBlock </h3> <br/><div> Guys I leave for 5 minutes and people are having mental breakdowns.<br><br>For starters, <span class="bb-bold">The picture of the Cat Block was FOR MikeDEV. <span class="bb-italic"><span class="bb-big">Relax</span></span></span><br><br>Second, nothing is wrong with page 236.
