Currently, we are only focusing on basic chat functionality. Emoticons will be added after the initial Alpha build is released.</blockquote>Understand. Incidentally, the meower will be a project, right? Whose project will be in the account then? Or are you going to create an account just for meower? Or will it be on a separate website? *, I need to inform myself</blockquote><br>The alpha release will be released on Scratch, and I will publish it. Communications with the project will be handled by my test account, using code written by @-CloudGate- et. al. In the future, I will create an alt account specifically for the Meower project and re-share it there.<br><br>Meower's spinoff project, Yoom, will be released on my Github pages, as a CloudLink-based version of the project. That will serve as my testing grounds for crude video chats as well as classic whitelist chat. Meower, since it's on Native Scratch, will stay with phrase-based chats and have no video chat functionality (cloud var. bandwidth limitations). </div><hr \><h3> Codingland </h3> <br/><div> There could be an image engine which allows you to post art or choose preset images </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Codingland wrote:</p>There could be an image engine which allows you to post art or choose preset images</blockquote><br>User profile pages will have a feature that will allow you to choose preset images as a profile photo.
