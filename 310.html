I know we’re all waiting on CloudDisc development, and thats OK. But I had an idea regarding the phrase system itself. I find that it’s kind of hard to say anything you would use in a conversation. For example, “I like ice cream. Do you?” It’s just… not possible in Meower at the moment. There would just be too many nouns to flip through to find “ice cream”. I could “like” thousands of other things and the list of phrases would be unworkable.<br><br>I know I’m new here, but I want to suggest a possible alternative system.<br><br>1. Breaking down sentences. We don’t need to add everything possible to a list. There are different parts of sentences. “I like” is one part, “Ice cream” and “do you?” are others. We could instead set <span class="bb-bold">parameters</span> for sentence structure. Not whitelisted, but in a tactful way to allow people to express themselves.<br><br>2. Finding words themselves. After you pick the first sentence piece (“I like”), it opens up the noun list. As you type the next word you want to add, the list could be narrowed down to all the nouns involving “ice” <span class="bb-italic">blue ice, ice cream, ice, lice, licorice</span> and many others in the archives.<br><br>Griffpatch’s cloud 3D shooter game (broken) uses a similar system. But I think adding set parameters instead of 100% set phrases would open up Meower as the best chat.<br><br>Here are some example lists:<br>expressions: <span class="bb-bold">I like, I enjoy, I wish, I hope, I dislike, I wonder, I think</span> etc<br>nouns: <span class="bb-bold">MikeDEV, ice cream, house, car, banana</span> this is a big list<br>verbs: <span class="bb-bold">run{ran, is running, run, will be running} fly{flew, is flying, will be flying}</span><br>questions: …<br><br>You get the point. There would also be adjectives and all the other parts of speech.<br>And then the parameters:<br>1. expression - noun <br>2. noun - verb<br>3. expression - adjective - noun<br><br>Now I know this is a lot, but I’ve been thinking about this idea for a while. I couldn’t do it all by myself. If this system isn’t what you guys are looking for, that’s fine. But I think something like this would really improve Yoom and Meower. Let me know what you think!<br><br>And I want to acknowledge the possibility of saying something like, “I dislike you”. Is it <span class="bb-italic">really a bad thing?</span> There could be a good reason for saying that. The Scratch website will even let me say “I hate you” <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__5fa268af9b198f5e02c06c13d1b8cc19__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/yikes.png"> Now, of course, “hate” wouldn’t be allowed in any of the lists. It’s a very strong word. I think (from a moral standard) being able to say this might be ok.<br><br>Edit: lol I had to edit the heck out of this because of the square brackets I used.
