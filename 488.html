I will try my best to release Beta 5 today.<br><br>As for the upcoming features within Beta 5:<br><br>1. A completely redesigned look and feel, with a focus on user experience. We're putting in more friendlier screens and simplified menus. Of course, you can always choose the old Meower layout.<br>2. Group and private chats. You can invite other Meower members to chats you create and quickly share ideas or collaborate in real-time.<br>3. Better safety features. We're putting all the stops in our moderation features. We'll be working around the clock to keep Meower safe.<br>4. Widescreen and mobile support. We've upgraded to a 16:9 aspect ratio and added support for touchscreen devices.<br>5. For developers, we're making Meower more open to 3rd party services and clients. You'll hear more about this feature later.<br><br>That's all for now.
