As for the time being, I will replace them with on-screen buttons to scroll up/down.  </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> Mini update: Here's a list of things I've done/I'm working on with Meower/Yoom:<br><br>* I've created an OOBE (Out-Of-Box Experience) GUI, as a friendly and welcoming screen that plays music while you set up your account and read the ToS/ Privacy Policy. <br>* I'm still working on finalizing the Search GUI. It works, but I'm still not sure how it will look.<br>* I've finished up a barebones post creation GUI (though at this time it only uses keyboard input, since I'm developing the project using Turbowarp). I'll be working on a discussion thread creator and eventually implementing BBCode+ enhancements and (eventually) a proper whitelisted phrase selector/generator GUI.<br>* The profile page is almost complete.<br>* I've never actually used the debug menu, and I'm considering removing it.<br>* Fixed a bug where conflicting button inputs would cause problems.<br><br>Share your thoughts/ideas/complaints here! </div><hr \><h3> silvxrcat </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>Mini update: Here's a list of things I've done/I'm working on with Meower/Yoom:<br><br>* I've created an OOBE (Out-Of-Box Experience) GUI, as a friendly and welcoming screen that plays music while you set up your account and read the ToS/ Privacy Policy. <br>* I'm still working on finalizing the Search GUI.
