Not cheats. Just a tool box that allows scratchers to customize the program and add small features</blockquote><br>If I recall earlier, we had another sister project, Woofer, which is similar to that?<br><br>I made the project versatile enough to allow custom theme creation, it's very limited for customization features. A lot of the functionality in Meower is hard-coded and would require a major overhaul to add said features. There's a reason why I removed the “Automatic Translation”, “Auto TTS”, etc. features since they will take longer to implement.<br><br>Our current priority is to <span class="bb-italic">figure out</span> a phrase selector GUI and add it. From there we do a bit of connecting code and final testing.<br><br>In the future, if you really wanted to play around with modding, I would suggest forking Yoom (Meower's feature-rich, yet forbidden, sister project). </div><hr \><h3> BertieBoy </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">NILL_GAMES10 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">ATJAT wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">BertieBoy wrote:</p>I keep misreading Meower as Meowser</blockquote><span class="bb-big">*Super Mario 3D World intensifies*</span></blockquote>I have some violent memories of that game…<br>Involving my siblisngs…</blockquote>r e l a t a b l e </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> …also, has anyone come up with a design for the phrase selection GUI?<br><br>It needs to be able to work with the limits of the Meower UI design.<br><br>1.
