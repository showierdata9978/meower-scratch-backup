However, i explained that would not work due to the lack of computing power and various other reasons. We still need someone to host the server, if I’m not mistaken, by running the project constantly.</blockquote><br>i can do it</blockquote>Well you see, you're not part of the team.</blockquote>i can run the pi server. just tell me what i have to do.</blockquote><br>Like I said, you can TRY the pi server but you will hate it. Raspberry pi’s are so bad at that kind of thing. It takes 10 minutes to open a browser window. They laggggg, and are 100% guaranteed not to run a scratch project at all. Case closed.</blockquote>ummm… what model of rpi are you using? a 1gb ram one? also, we wont be doing anything too intensive with it, just hosting a python program. i know that stuff like that barely takes up any ram. its not like we're hosting an MC server</blockquote><br>Just a V3. How do you connect a python program to a scratch project? Anyway, maybe you’re correct. I’m not sure about the V4, but I doubt it’s much better. If you would like to use a pi, we can use mine, if that suites the project. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">-CloudGate- wrote:</p><span class="bb-big"><span class="bb-underline"><span class="bb-bold">I HAVE FINISHED A PART OF THE LIST.
