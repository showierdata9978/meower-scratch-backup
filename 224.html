I suggest we stay small in the work of Meower until September, mainly making ideas and fixing old bugs. When more people are online, we can start to get back to work in bigger terms. This way, we won't get too much work done without the ones who want to contribute their ideas but cannot access the internet.</blockquote>That is true but:<br>People having been waiting on Meower for probably a year now. And the release dates that keep getting changed are really making people more anxious. If there is a entire 2 month extent people might get bored and even forget about Meower. The small 10 day extents are ok. But 2 months is too much. I don't make decisions of course but thats my opinion. </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> im gonna start making a file structure for the meower servers, can you give some small ideas? </div><hr \><h3> -CloudGate- </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">bloctans_4 wrote:</p>im gonna start making a file structure for the meower servers, can you give some small ideas?</blockquote>we have one.
