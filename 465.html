For Example, naming a cloud variable “☁ open link” allows it to open a url in a new tab when the value is set to that variable.<br><br>(Although, it would be hard to be able to register a user's click to a piece of text, so there could instead be a button on the bottom of a post which sends the user to that link.) </div><hr \><a href="/467.html"> Next page </a>
