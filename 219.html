Right now for the beta to come out we need at least a phrase list completed. We also need servers. If we want to do it in repl.it like we planned, then wee need people who are good at using the API and stuff and also understand how to make it connect to the the scratch side. i don't know how to use the API so you need someone else to do that. i will explain to them how the system works and do the scratch side of things. We also need people to make the phrase whitelist. Maybe make a form for people to submit words. Anyways it will take a month or 2 to get that sorted out. beta testing shouldn't take too long I think.</blockquote> </div><hr \><h3> DevonianMapping </h3> <br/><div> Can there be a TurboWarp version with 16:9 and 60fps? </div><hr \><a href="/meower-scratch-backup/220.html"> Next page </a>
