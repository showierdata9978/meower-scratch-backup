Because of this, the only significant role of moderators is to manage and control spam, as well as flag users for spamming. They are also responsible for managing spam reports and also collecting bug reports.</blockquote>From a cloud point of view, I don't think that spam is going to be much of a problem because even computers can recognise spam… of course, humans are always more reliable, because there will always be loopholes in any program, it's just whether we see it or not. Most likely problems will be the user using numbers and special characters to replace words, that one will bypass filters as someoneyouknow and someoneyouknoœ will be seen as 2 different words, and all the E's can become 3's and so on… another possible problem will be when a user tries to say hi to many different people, it may take hi as spam… guess that @Mikedev, as the owner of this project, I think it's up to you to see if we should add in a computerised spam filtering system. </div><hr \><h3> -Mysticoder- </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Dotumantaraye wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">ldadventures wrote:</p>I will pick good projects that are not currently on the front page or the explore tab, so some fairly unknown scratchers may get a spotlight.</blockquote>…elaborate? <span class="bb-small">fyi advertiser is for advertising meower, if you're thinking of something else.</span></blockquote>Wait… actually, advertising other projects seem to sound quite interesting, from a buisness point of view, that is. However, yeah, advertisers currently advertise Meower, not attach ads of other projects to Meower. Either way, even if we put up ads for others, it's most likely going to be done by Moderators, up to @Mikedev again… </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> Small snippet of what's going on right now:<br><br>Menus are working now!
