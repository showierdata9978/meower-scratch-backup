It's my fault for not being specific about it. As I mentioned above, only the messages you post will be collected. Whoever's threads you view, posts you look at, or the people you just notice, will not be logged. Data collection is strictly limited to messages/posts/comments/threads, accounts, and diagnostics (which includes the date/time of account creation or a login/logout attempt). </div><hr \><h3> KSK_games </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><blockquote><span class="bb-bold">We only collect data that is needed to make our service work, which includes:</span><br><br>&gt; A username and password for authentication, as well as account security.<span class="bb-small"> (This should be pretty standard.)</span><br><br>&gt; Posts, messages, comments, threads, anything that is a form of messaging needs that to be saved/loaded.<span class="bb-small"> (Kinda need to be able to store data to get data.)</span><br><br>&gt; Basic diagnostic data to help correct troubles as well as anonymously generate statistics. <span class="bb-small">(How many people are using Meower today?)</span><br><br>&gt; Record posts/messages/comments/threads for moderation purposes. <span class="bb-small">(Did someone say a no-no word?)</span><br></blockquote><blockquote><span class="bb-bold">Whatever happens to your data, we handle it ethically.</span><br><br>&gt; We don't collect data that can be used to identify who you are in real life, and we don't sell our data to anyone. <span class="bb-small">(If you're really keen on seeing how we do this, there's a reason why we're FOSS)</span><br><br>&gt; If you desire to view (or delete) your diagnostic data, you can let us know directly.<br><br>&gt; If you feel the need to, you can request to have your account (as well as diagnostic data and posts/messages/comments/threads) deleted.</blockquote><span class="bb-bold"><span class="bb-italic">And, if you feel skeptical about the aforementioned, anyone and everyone is more than welcome to view the source code.
