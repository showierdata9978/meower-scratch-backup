<h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> Update: Experimental phrase selector is no longer experimental! This improved GUI has built-in autocorrection features, which simplifies the phrase selection process. When you select certain words, the options to choose from narrow down. These are the building blocks of a phrase, and each resulting phrase will always be a predefined, permitted phrase! It also removes the requirement of having separate categories for words, which speeds up development by a LOT. All we need now is to expand the phrase database for more advanced conversations!<br><br>Remember, if a phrase needs to mention a user, please use “@(ausername)”.<br><br><img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/ac525780c25cfa051f6a4abbf91307e3.png"><br><img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/6e2133b7dfb99ef013b5e29e2fbf8525.png"><br><img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/c34398b6c1fcee1be8dd6703997bd878.png"><br><img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/d2c1104bfe2f9eaafe73f1d33a2df7cc.png"><br><img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/e4af0bd22b5ed4a5d69d05943a24dc26.png"><br><img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/e43010b88067d535aa9f2d4b1bf00142.png"><br><img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/9e0b753df93ed78caf2a4fa8d0ac537b.png"><br><br>Attached above are some screenshots of the improved post creator GUI.<br><br>I also improved phrase verification, so there are 2 layers of added security. In the event that the user selects “Post”, the entire message goes through 2 levels of verification.<br><br>Verification level 1 checks if each phrase in the post exists within the database. Any phrases that are modified will fail this level. Any phrase that is not modified in a post will pass, and go onto level 2.<br><br>Verification level 2 re-converts the output of level 1's checks and confirms if there are no irregularities with the transmission. If a post uses corrupted data, this level will fail. If the phrases are within the permitted database, and that the message hasn't been irregularly tampered with, the message will be permitted to send. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> The project has been updated to reflect changes to the post creator GUI.<br><br><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/468221502/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/468221502/</a><br><br>Also, note that the @(ausername) tag will be modified to only allow a selection from a list of online users, someone you follow, or a friend.
