Phrase database is incomplete, that's why some categories throw an error.<br>2. Backspace / Space options aren't coded in yet.<br>3. Settings not displaying the correct output may be a synchronization problem, as it seems that on slower computers some scripts may desynchronize (will be looking into)<br>4. A lot of functionality is currently dependent on the cloud networking code, hence why there's a bunch of placeholder text<br>5. OOBE GUI will be improved soon, a tutorial script will be introduced soon<br>6.
