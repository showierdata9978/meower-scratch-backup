However, they have decided not to review Unlicensed because it has not been written by legal professionals.<br></blockquote>,<br>so the GPL would also make this project eligible for OSI certification if wanted. (although it is impractical.)<br><br>Although the license is long when it is in its full form, there is a shortened version.<br><blockquote>You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files. Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL3-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL3 along with build &amp; install instructions.</blockquote> </div><hr \><a href="/?p=79"> Next page </a>
