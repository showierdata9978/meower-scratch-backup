This is the Meower forum. Please make only on-topic posts because we kinda have a problem with off-topicness </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> For the first time in forever~<br><br>Some updates!<br><br>1. I fixed some things related to CloudLink so Meower should now have a more sane login prompt.<br>2. I just started implementing of CloudDisk! But, I still have to finish CloudDisk, but I will simultaneously develop Meower alongside CD.<br>3. I'm considering importing some components of Yoom's GUI to improve Meower's GUI in the future. Let me know what you guys think about it.<br>4. If I were to stream my development process via a link on my (nono word) status, would you guys watch it?<br><br>And… for the news you all have been loathing.<br><br>I have concluded that publishing Meower on Scratch is too risky, so as soon as Beta 4.5 is complete, we will no longer be publishing builds of Meower on Scratch, indefinitely. We will be moving all development and releases onto Github or other self-managed solutions. There are too many issues going on with Scratch's management and I don't want Meower to get the ax by someone else's hands.<br><br>We will never give up! See you all soon. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Maclator wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Maclator wrote:</p>how can I help with meower <span class="bb-small">(I know the process I just want to know what things to do that are actually… useful)</span></blockquote><br>As of now, nothing much.
