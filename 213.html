I will focus on finishing the port of the phrase list into Meower PhraseDB for Scratch Team verification. I've been very busy lately with catching up on chores and other miscellaneous things <span class="bb-italic">(being the youngest of a family of 4: I'm basically the butler </span><img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__b11a1b28a145ad546a3ec63b166951da__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/lol.png"><span class="bb-italic">)</span> I've been feeling pretty burnt out working on Meower so I've been taking a break from it. I'm ready to get back to working on the project. I'll post updates about it soon.<br><br>2. I've been considering abandoning the idea of having the project hosted on Scratch. If I cannot get Scratch Team verification, Yoom (Meower's sister project, hosted independently from Scratch and shared VIA GitHub) will become Meower and Meower will not be released on Scratch.<br><br>3. While I wouldn't ever leave without a serious reason to do so, I've been considering relinquishing my ownership of Meower and making Yoom an independent project once more.  <span class="bb-italic">I'm about to go on a long, heartfelt explanation, so if you don't have the time then you can stop here.</span><blockquote>Lately, I've been having my own doubts about Meower, and I've also been questioning my status as a member of this website. I've considered leaving several times in the past. One time, I considered being a Godot game developer, but I never really had the time to study the game engine. Another time I wanted to leave because of the rules on the cloud being too restrictive. And other times I wanted to leave because there's nothing really else left to do: no motivation to work on things anymore, and innovations that could help out the community left unnoticed under the shadows of “generic” projects and other things. The only reason I stick around this website anymore is that (1) the programming language is simple and visual-based (Easier for me to read than text-based languages, my vision is getting weak), and (2) because of a little project named Meower.<br><br>For those who weren't aware, long before Meower was a thing, I started work on Yoom. It was near complete for a public test. Then the new rules about the cloud came, effectively killing the project. It also forever crippled another project of mine, CatChat. CatChat, by far one of my most successful projects (second to Meower), was crippled because of cloud limitations. I considered leaving the website for a final time. I lingered around for a little longer, just waiting for a small glimmer of hope. Then I stumbled upon Meower, or more appropriately: Scratch Connect. I was skeptical about the project, and even had a lot of doubt about it. But because of the premise of a cloud chat with a unique phrase-based system, I was inspired to revive Yoom. And then I became a member, developing a frontend using concept artwork from other talented Scratchers. Later on, I became the owner of the project, and the rest is history.<br><br>Now, Meower has become something much larger than I'd ever expected it to become. Everyone is cheering us on, waiting for the project to be released, despite the project being put on hold for so long. If I can't get the project released because of the primary feature of it, then Meower is doomed as a collaboration. I really don't want to let the project die, but I also don't want it to be blocked. The previews have been NFE'd, which isn't even a good sign (It doesn't even have cloud functionality! It's just the graphics!). I really hope things don't turn dire.</blockquote></blockquote><br><span class="bb-italic"><span class="bb-bold">TL;DR Meower may be doomed if we don't work on it. We need to focus on the main project. Please report @Keyweed if they harass you.
