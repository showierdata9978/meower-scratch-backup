As for Meower itself, not so much. I stumbled upon a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/545728377/">SHA256 engine</a> that works in Scratch so I can emulate something similar to SSL or TLS, and also implement <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76058228/">ACE</a>…<br><br>Since CloudLink has both global and private/direct data links I can do sanity and security checks with the servers over the aforementioned. Seems like I could just hash a bunch of keys together and verify if the server has matching results, and vice-versa, and if both ends check out the server and client are valid and trusted. Since this code must be present and that keys must be distributed to the clients, this implementation is secure enough to provide a strong standard for security, but then comes the issue of actually protecting the server ip address, which I can't hide in code.</blockquote>wait how do we even dehash the html then without letting anyone dehash it, and also chrome devtools </div><hr \><h3> silvxrcat </h3> <br/><div> my computer made ntfs.sys crash my computer with “exception in invalid file” or something<br><br>welp, found on forums this could be easily fixed, but some people resorted to resetting the whole entire pc.<br><br>dang. </div><hr \><a href="/?p=363"> Next page </a>
