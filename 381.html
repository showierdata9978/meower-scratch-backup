It asks you to use a Scratch Username, BUT it asks you use a <span class="bb-bold">unique</span> password. The only reason why I mention a Scratch username is so that CloudAccount 2-Factor Authentication will work (if you choose to use it) and help with identification. <br><br>2. Passwords are hashed with SHA256 TWICE.<span class="bb-bold"> I do not (and cannot) see what you send.</span> CloudAccount <span class="bb-bold">stores password hashes only</span>, I cannot see your passwords. </div><hr \><a href="/meower-scratch-backup/383.html"> Next page </a>
