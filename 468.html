My question is: what if emojis could be typed similar to how they are in the forums? When someone receives the special lines of text, Meower would just replace the text with a few spaces, and tell the emoji sprite to draw one in its place. Is that not possible? <br><br>Either way, I created an <a href="https://turbowarp.org/631831463">emoji resource</a>, and I think it’s pretty cool. I even spent some time making a basic “emoji keyboard”, which you can (eventually) press to add to your message. I tried to make it as simple as possible, whilst also being fast and polished. Simple code for a high-schooler. There will also be a special @MikeDEV emoji, but I haven’t fully added it in yet <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__03550696c41ed0b9c8e860c6cb190a16__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/wink.png"><br><br>Stubbornly, I don’t see why we can’t add them.
