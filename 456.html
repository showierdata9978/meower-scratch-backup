Remember me? I was originally going to be an emoji designer, but did not get any of my designs used. Could I possibly become a playtester? I can be available on Saturdays-Sundays from 11am-11pm and Mondays-Fridays from 5pm-10pm. I won't <span class="bb-bold">always</span> be online, but I will try to help and notify bugs as much as possible. If you need to contact me, please message me on my profile as I usually do not check forum notifications. </div><hr \><a href="/meower-scratch-backup/458.html"> Next page </a>
