We have a (not perfect but functional) blocklist-style chat system powered by the Better-Profanity Python library. This is our first of a few protections.<br>2. Regardless of chat, it's all filtered by said library. Chats are all limited to either 360 or 100 characters or less.<br>3. I already have a few moderators deployed who can IP ban, account ban, delete posts and clear our homepages. We're going to be adding a report feature to all chats soon to help our moderators with the sorts. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Paddle2See wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Roblox888i wrote:</p>I just chatted in live chat.</blockquote>How does live chat work?

The only chat that doesn't store history (almost stateless) is our public livechat. Other than that, chat history is almost entirely public to all. Instead of moderation by fear, we moderate with transparency.<br>5. We're open to ideas on improving the security and safety of our platform. </div><hr \><h3> tnix100 </h3> <br/><div> 6. Account passwords are hashed and salted with bcrypt when stored in the database.<br>7. Better-profanity does quite a good job with censoring a lot of things, even more inoccent stuff such as “sucks”, it also doesn't allow bypasses such as “su3ks”<br>8.
