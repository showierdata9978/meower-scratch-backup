As a result of this, I'm sharing the source code for the project's beta 2 for now. It can be loaded in Turbowarp, Sheeptester's mod, and Adacraft. It requires loading CloudLink 3.0 to work.<br><br>The source code can be downloaded from my <a href="http://mikedev101.github.io">website</a>. Under the Meower section of the front page, a link can be found.<br><br>“NOTE: IF YOU ARE HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA 2 SOURCE CODE: CLICK HERE”<br><br>I'm not sharing the download link directly because of the ST.

That would mean if we did it, the Scratch servers would be <span class="bb-italic">used</span> (not just on) 24/7 and it costs money for that. Simply using a Raspberry Pi (a buildable PC) as a constant runner for an instant server would be better than taking advantage of an open-source website's server.<br><br><span class="bb-small">You get that?</span> </div><hr \><h3> RoboStudiosGames </h3> <br/><div> If Meower is not releasing on Scratch, why can't Meower have open chatting? </div><hr \><a href="./267.html"> Next page </a>
