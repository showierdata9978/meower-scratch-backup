You have to use whitelisted phrases.</blockquote>Also, just to add, blacklist is not allowed either. While there may be filters using translate and what have you, none of them can make blacklist cloud projects allowed under the Scratch Community Guidelines.</blockquote>I'm gonna say this as if I'm beating a dead horse, whitelists/blacklist chats were given the boot a long time ago (kinda sad though), and allowing users to freely write messages using text and blocking things before sending is no longer allowed, must have a predefined set of phrases or it's a no go.<br><br>In defense of the argument, That's fundamentally what <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/468649729/">this generator</a> is. It's fundamentally a whitelisted phrase generator, a more elegant system that I'll see if we can implement (if not, we'll have to generate a bulk list of all allowed phrases… which isn't elegant). <span class="bb-italic">(Please see the comments in the project for more info.)</span><br><br>Fundamentally, the generator ultimately is just a selector for different combinations of whitelisted phrases. For example…<br><br>“Hello”, “Hi”, “Welcome”, and “Bye” are allowed words that can be also whitelisted phrases. Forming unique combinations of these also form whitelisted phrases. “Hello! Welcome!” would be allowed, while something more random (as if it were typed out manually): “hello hello hello hello” wouldn't be permitted as it's not in the whitelist.<br><br>Implementing a phrase generator that creates permitted phrases would still <span class="bb-italic">technically</span> comply with the rules, but again I'm still not 100% sure at this time. I really don't want to have users select an entire sentence from a long, boring list of prewritten phrases when you can assemble a phrase in the generator and still have it pass through a whitelisted phrase verification check. The design is simple enough to use, and does work, as this is fundamentally what Disney did back when Club Penguin was still around (and assuming your account was set to safe chat mode).<br><br>If It's not allowed, I don't mind complying with the rules. But I would really like a second opinion from the ST before we make a final decision. </div><hr \><h3> NILL_GAMES10 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">looserty wrote:</p>Hi!!!
