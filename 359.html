I would like to keep Meower secure by design.<br><br>Since Meower will depend on CloudLink Suite, CloudLink itself will need to depend upon the security of both CloudAccount and CloudDisk. My biggest improvement from old CloudLink is the implementation of 2-Factor Authentication, as well as OTSKs (One-Time Session Keys), which are special token keys that can only be used for one logged in user, and can be used to authenticate other services (which in this case, CloudDisk). <br><br>My biggest concern regarding security is obvious stupidity on my part. One obvious security note is to keep the Meower server IP private, and purged from source code, and only stored (with very good obfuscation) in compiled binaries/HTML files. I'm also considering implementing a new security feature for CloudLink servers, and that is Trusted Access keys. these keys can be generated on the server-side and can be stored in a project as a variable. Ideally, you would compile the project and have the project send that code to the server to verify access, and purge the variable's data when distributing open-source code. Think of it as something similar to SSL.</blockquote>html is easy to decompile…. </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> like, most html5 compilers keep the source in the compiled thing, like the haxefixel compiler or the many scratch compilers </div><hr \><h3> silvxrcat </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Jeffalo wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">johnelr wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">CST1229 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">zedthehedgehog wrote:</p><img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/zedthehedgehog/firefoxmc7uPW8w8m.png"><br><br>scratch team using extensions exposed</blockquote>ik it might be a joke but iirc that was not set by the user and was from back in the shefwerld stats days (before the statuses were merged into ocular) when statuses were set as jokes</blockquote>i think its funny scratch team themselves use an extension made by the community</blockquote>they don't</blockquote>technically.<br><br>well, currently the only way to “see” these statuses are by extensions. either they used only the website and not the extension, or ended up using both. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">bloctans_4 wrote:</p>html is easy to decompile….</blockquote><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">bloctans_4 wrote:</p>like, most html5 compilers keep the source in the compiled thing, like the haxefixel compiler or the many scratch compilers</blockquote><br>Well, any suggestions then?

As for Meower itself, not so much. I stumbled upon a <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/545728377/">SHA256 engine</a> that works in Scratch so I can emulate something similar to SSL or TLS, and also implement <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76058228/">ACE</a>…<br><br>Since CloudLink has both global and private/direct data links I can do sanity and security checks with the servers over the aforementioned. Seems like I could just hash a bunch of keys together and verify if the server has matching results, and vice-versa, and if both ends check out the server and client are valid and trusted. Since this code must be present and that keys must be distributed to the clients, this implementation is secure enough to provide a strong standard for security, but then comes the issue of actually protecting the server ip address, which I can't hide in code. </div><hr \><h3> GlitchedExe </h3> <br/><div> Question out of the blue, why are 50% of the AMV's and animations about Wolves, AND WHY DO THE Wolves LOOK IDENTICAL, I NEED TO KNOW.
