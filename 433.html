You are right, there are a billion chat platforms and GitHub, but few are about scratch and Meower has gained 40k views on this forum. I would say knock yourself out but you're basically asking for everyone contributed, INCLUDING mikedev who has spent hours on it to pivot our work completely and try to build up again. </div><hr \><h3> ilym_ </h3> <br/><div> Cool cool, auth code? </div><hr \><h3> qrcool </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">ilym_ wrote:</p>Cool cool, auth code?</blockquote>?
