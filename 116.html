Either that or a pre-built phrase creator that only allows some words to follow others (So if you write ‘i’ you can’t select ‘love’ or ‘don’t like’). The second system isn’t entirely foolproof. Alternatively, you can build a set of code that takes a number between 10 and 99, then uses that as the ‘encoding key’. This key is then used to be added to the phrase number, then minused at the other side to decode. Each time a phrase is written, a new number is generated, so hacking will be harder unless somebody sets the ‘random number’ to always be the same, and excludes mutually exclusive phrases. </div><hr \><h3> DaCatBlock </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">ATJAT wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">meguy7878 wrote:</p>Don't u DARE put it to the 15th when there is TWO FLIPPING DAYS UNTIL IT COMES OUT</blockquote><br>I unexpectedly got busy, and I still haven't finished the last required feature: the phrase selector.
