If you want to use a less restrictive chat, please consider waiting for the release of Yoom, Meower's sister project, which I will be hosting independent of Scratch and using CloudLink 3.0. </div><hr \><h3> An_Alien_In_Disguise </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">An_Alien_In_Disguise wrote:</p>Can I also be a moderator? <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__28cf8ef6f921eab3cab54b8442c2b134__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/neutral.png"></blockquote><br>Long time, no see.
