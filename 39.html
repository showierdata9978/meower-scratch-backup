Like a paid membership or something.</blockquote><br>No. Meower is free to use, public domain, and open source. (also, that would violate Scratch's CGs.)<br><br>The only exception is user types. Normal users would classify as members. Moderators would classify as mods. Contributors would classify as contributors, and owners are owners. But that's just a label. </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">zedthehedgehog wrote:</p>Hi guys.

As for Meower, I'm not sure how turbo warp detection would work. Back then, in the 2.0 days, you could detect phosphorous/sulfurous by exploiting a unique characteristic of the arithmetic libraries, but I'm not sure about now. Supposedly you should have a block labeled “is compiled?” in a turbowarp project to detect turbowarp but I'm not sure if it's the other way around…</blockquote>yeah i think i have a is compiled block</blockquote>I remember how to detect forkphorus- it was using an equal boolean and math. </div><hr \><h3> silvxrcat </h3> <br/><div> the mascot should be a cat in the style of rhythm heaven fever </div><hr \><h3> yooit_32 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">silvxrcat wrote:</p>the mascot should be a cat in the style of rhythm heaven fever</blockquote>I agree. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">yooit_32 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">silvxrcat wrote:</p>the mascot should be a cat in the style of rhythm heaven fever</blockquote>I agree.</blockquote><br>Make a design, someone!
