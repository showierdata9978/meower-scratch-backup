If you wan't to be a coder, you should wait until updates are available to create, because we don't want to delay Meower. We've been waiting for 2 years for this to come out (or I have at least) so I think you should wait until we can add more to Meower. </div><hr \><h3> meguy7878 </h3> <br/><div> I just think making the like button a paw is just cute <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__44c0b4b4b4ff883d4327d3dbdf80ae44__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/smile.png"> <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__44c0b4b4b4ff883d4327d3dbdf80ae44__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/big_smile.png"><img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__44c0b4b4b4ff883d4327d3dbdf80ae44__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/cool.png"><img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__44c0b4b4b4ff883d4327d3dbdf80ae44__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/cool.png"><img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__44c0b4b4b4ff883d4327d3dbdf80ae44__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/cool.png"> </div><hr \><h3> CST1229 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">meguy7878 wrote:</p>How do we change the name of our user to our actual username?
