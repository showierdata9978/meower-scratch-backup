I am all caught up and have an Idea that I could possibly do. There are many Os's with app stores, I figured I could work on a demo app for any Os's that want it! I am also available for anything else. Again, sorry for being inactive this summer. </div><hr \><h3> DaCatBlock </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">windowscj wrote:</p>Hi!
