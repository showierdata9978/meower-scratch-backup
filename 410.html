<h3> Fat_Cat222 </h3> <br/><div> Hello there, I am @-Exphire-. I signed up for a moderator position awhile back but had to leave due to being inactive. I recently was told that you are once again looking for moderators and was asked if I would like to rejoin, and to that I say… uh… sure! However, I would like to rejoin on this account, rather than the one I originally joined on. Is that okay? If you would like me to confirm somewhere that I am the same person, let me know and I can do it.  </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV_Test </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">GlitchedExe wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV_Test wrote:</p>Currently making a “Meower in Retrospect” project for the 2021 studio!

I'm busy with fixing Meower's current flaws and bugs, and hopefully it will be back and working soon. I'll also be publishing a project that will allow former members to be easily re-added for jobs, and I'll be able to directly see who rejoins and then verify old jobs. Keep an eye out for it!<br><br>Also, I forgot to mention in this thread: I have a preview of the new and improved authentication system!<br><a href="/discuss/youtube/HUPAGgFyAdo/">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUPAGgFyAdo</a> </div><hr \><h3> mccann119 </h3> <br/><div> My browser / operating system: ChromeOS 14150.87.0, Chrome 94.0.4606.124, No Flash version detected<br>Meower won't run </div><hr \><h3> DaCatBlock </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV_Test wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">GlitchedExe wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV_Test wrote:</p>Currently making a “Meower in Retrospect” project for the 2021 studio!
