An active meter would be cool, and when it comes out, new applications can come out for moderators and other jobs within the project, and things like  temporarily cloud bans would be possible to those who violate the rules. This way we can stop things like spammers and scammers. And when searching up a user, you can see a crime record that they have (like bans, reasons for bans, etc) so that you can be aware of what you have to be careful with when talking to them.  Avatars should be picked from a small list of pictures, so that cloud appliments to those use won't use lots of clones. Banned users will not be able to talk, follow, or do anything publicly to anyone on the project. Users can also be deleted, causing searches of the user to end up in a error, and the user unable to remake the account. Most Easter eggs should be around late March to mid April. Some easter eggs will remain year round just for fun, like @MikeDev said. Good job if you actually read all of that.<br><br>Things like advertising should probably be allowed, as it is not very harmful, but over use of it may lead to a temporary ban.<br><br>I'll try making a scratch project that will explain all of this in a rule book, which can be added to the project, or just remain in the notes and be recommended to read before using Meower. <br><br>It would be cool, and useful. <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__44c0b4b4b4ff883d4327d3dbdf80ae44__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/smile.png"> </div><hr \><h3> meguy7878 </h3> <br/><div> And yes, Mikedev, we will all be in BIG TROUBLE if we lie to Scratch!!! <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__44c0b4b4b4ff883d4327d3dbdf80ae44__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/sad.png"> I think we might have to delay Meower a little for the changes. But I guess we should just have Meower publicized and go throughout the process to check for any ways that someone may harm another in words or phrases. If we see it is all fine, I think we should contact a member of the Scratch Team to check it over before Meower can be used. Some developer tools would be useful, like the shutdown of servers or something. But somehow Meower will get through it all <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__44c0b4b4b4ff883d4327d3dbdf80ae44__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/smile.png"> </div><hr \><h3> samq64 </h3> <br/><div> I think you misunderstood my post earlier, could someone please remove me from the calibrators list? </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> <img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/8099bc3b65b67dc680898af63ca4806f.png"> </div><hr \><h3> legobuilder000 </h3> <br/><div> We should maybe ask the Scratch Team if we can do this, I mean, wouldn't a publicly shown list for ban reasons be gossiping?

This is Meower's 100% honest clarification.<br><br>Meower and Yoom are 2 sides of the same coin, they will share the same fundamental code. Meower will be restricted in its features since we have to comply with the rules. Yoom will serve as a playground for these features.<br><br>Here are the differences:<br><br><span class="bb-bold">Meower (Scratch, Scratch hosted)</span><br>&gt; Uses Cloud Variables<br>&gt; Relies upon p2p (Peer-2-Peer) comms for file storage<br>&gt; Custom PFP functionality disabled<br>&gt; Predefined phrase-based chat*<br>&gt; Search functionality limited<br>&gt; No user quotes on profile pages<br>&gt; Pseudo Real-Time chats<br>&gt; Private comms are not possible, all comms are public<br><br><span class="bb-bold">Yoom (Compiled HTML, independently hosted)</span><br>&gt; CloudLink-based<br>&gt; Uses custom cloudlink-based server for file storage<br>&gt; Custom PFP support + User camera support (will require consent to privacy policy)<br>&gt; Traditional, hyper-sensitive whitelist-based chat (+ support for a phrase-based chat if needed)<br>&gt; Full-text search<br>&gt; True real-time chat<br>&gt; Direct Messages support<br>&gt; Experimental “calling” support (will be using a hyper-sensitive whitelist)<br><br><span class="bb-bold">Both:</span><br>&gt; Profile pages will have basic user status (online, offline, idle, away, do not disturb, banned/kicked)<br>&gt; Rely upon servers for storage/comms<br>&gt; Allow moderated, secure chat<br>&gt; Block sharing of personal info (emails, addresses, phone numbers, etc.)<br>&gt; Have easter eggs<br>&gt; Have a sense of humor<br>&gt; Emoji support (Due to technical complications, Emojis will be added in a later update)<br><br><span class="bb-bold">*The GUI will allow you to select and assemble sentences using pre-approved phrases. HOWEVER, they will only be permitted if they are within the permitted predefined phrases list… The phrase assembler is a more user-friendly approach to this phrase-only chat limitation.</span><br><br><span class="bb-underline">The only reason why the preview allows free text is that <span class="bb-bold">the phrase selector is not complete</span>. Free text support will be removed in the release candidate of Meower.</span><br><br>I hope I cleared up some things. I'm not lying to anyone. If you feel like there is something wrong with Meower, you can remix it and fix issues, and request a review of the code for merging. Meower is FOSS, and we should embrace it.<br><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">samq64 wrote:</p>I think you misunderstood my post earlier, could someone please remove me from the calibrators list?</blockquote>Sorry, I will remove you<br><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">bloctans_4 wrote:</p><img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/8099bc3b65b67dc680898af63ca4806f.png"></blockquote>Nice koala, but the camera feature will be removed in Meower and only used in Yoom, as I mentioned before </div><hr \><h3> IceCreamTub </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">bloctans_4 wrote:</p><img src="https://assets.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/.%2E/8099bc3b65b67dc680898af63ca4806f.png"></blockquote>how would you change profile pics tho? </div><hr \><a href="/?p=96"> Next page </a>
