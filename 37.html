I fixed a few bugs (as well as discovered a few more) and added our privacy policy. I added a shortcut to the about meower page, and did some work on the search GUI as well as implemented the post creation GUI. The topic/thread creation GUI is under construction, so there's nothing there for now. Other than that, Meower is getting closer to being ready for Scratch! </div><hr \><h3> Real_WeBino </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">GuitarGuyPlayz wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">GuitarGuyPlayz wrote:</p>Where do I get this?</blockquote><br>Meower is almost finished (but still in development), however, you can take a look at the demo here: <span>https://turbowarp.org/468221502?fps=60&amp;hqpen&amp;stuck</span></blockquote><br>Wow!
