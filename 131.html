If the message is too long to sent in one message then it's split into parts that go one by one. Multiple messages can be sent at once depending on how many cloud vars there are that are hooked up to this system.

That also includes new Scratchers… As far as I know, there's not really a way to prevent this because there's no way to authenticate cloud requests. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> Due to unforeseen circumstances, I will not be able to see Meower at its release. I entrust you all to complete the remaining components of the project.<br><br>For reference, this is the list of tasks needed to be accomplished before June 15:<br><br>1. Complete the phrase database.<br>2. Connect it to cloud networking code.<br>3. Test the project.<br><br>Sorry, everyone. I have to get going for now. I will see you all later. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> Also, I should provide a little bit of documentation on how the phrase system works.<br><br>There is a list called “WORDS”, which contains the first component of the phrase system.
