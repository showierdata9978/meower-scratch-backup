When you are displaying messages, you need info to display it(who sent it, what are its contents). Make the system that generates what needs to be sent then I'll hook it up. @-Mysticoder- if you have any questions about the engine then ask on the project(in the studio and called “super cloud engine fixed” or something of the sort) </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">-CloudGate- wrote:</p>The cloud engine is basically done.

Just one question though: Does your system assign a unique ID to every post? If so, indexing posts will be easier, as I'll explain below…<br><br>I'm gonna link this old project of mine for reference on how I believe we should be able to do the chat generator. <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/468649729/">https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/468649729/</a><br><br>It may look like a free chat system, but it really is just a more elegant whitelist phrase combo system with various combinations.<br>While this preview is buggy such as numbers and usernames, it provides the building blocks of how I'd like to make our messaging system.<br><br>As of right now, I also came up with a new feature to include in the top menu bar: a search function. Not only it allows you to display a global whitelist phrase chat, search up certain topics, or look up certain users.<br><br>The user profile page is kind of bland at the moment, so I also came up with a design. On our right side of the screen, there's options to add friend, send a message, and or report the user (this is mainly for spam). To the left, the user's profile icon that can be customized, and a status indicator (this feature may be buggy due to cloud var. limitations). And below the screen is a recent posts list that we can simply fetch from the server(s). </div><hr \><h3> johnelr </h3> <br/><div> im still gonna be in this project. </div><hr \><h3> johnelr </h3> <br/><div> is work on meower+ continuing </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">johnelr wrote:</p>im still gonna be in this project.</blockquote><br>(Post 4) Thank you for confirming your status.
