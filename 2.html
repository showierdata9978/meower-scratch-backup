We would also encode the passwords more than the other things. Wait, would we really need passwords?

Scratch automatically disables changes to the cloud variable server if you attempt to view the project's code.<br><br>As far as the CloudLink-based fork of meower goes, I'm using server-side SHA-256 hashing for my database's password data. This is really bare-bones, but it does help.<br><br>As for native Scratch, I would recommend using something like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/76058228/">Advanced Cryptography Engine</a>. I made an old engine called “Network Engine” (Not available anymore because it got taken down by the ST), which used ACE to encrypt connections. It shared a client-specific randomly-generated hex key on every new encrypted connection that is immediately destroyed after a disconnect. </blockquote><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">DabDatBass wrote:</p>I just realized this, but we need a way to make a new line. “\n” makes sence.<br><br><span class="bb-big">Also, I need a project that has both the pen and zed gui in it and the cloud engine.</span></blockquote><br>My preview GUI's BBCode+ engine supports this, through the use of the newline tag: <div class="code"><pre>[n]</pre></div><br>You don't have to use<div class="code"><pre>[/n]</pre></div>to end the newline. It will be able to read end newline tags, but it won't do anything. Only the start newline tag draws the next text data under a new line.<br><br>For example, someone could create a post (using the phrase selector, of course) and stylize it. They can declare a new line as simple as this:<br><br><div class="code"><pre>[b]Hello! This is text that's not on a new line.[/b][n]Here is some text that is on a new line. ([/n] optional)</pre></div><br>Also just an FYI, the actual fancy boxes and buttons (not present ATM) on posts are contained within the <div class="code"><pre>[container] and [/container]</pre></div>tags.<br><br><div class="code"><pre>[container=Test]This is a sample container.[/container]</pre></div><br>If someone needs to create an empty container (or for a GUI element), use a space (this is currently a bug that I will not be fixing until the release canidate is published and live.)<br><br><div class="code"><pre>[container= ]Oops, an error occured.[/container]</pre></div></blockquote> </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">NILL_GAMES10 wrote:</p>Username: &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>Wanted job: ui designer  and programming.
