It's definitely a revolutionary Scratch project that will change the website forever. Thanks SO MUCH to the Meower team for working so hard to put together this fascinating and community-guidelines-abiding project. I can't wait to try it out!<br><br><span class="bb-italic">it would be helpful if there was a tutorial or something going over every feature, if there is then sorry lol</span></blockquote>^ made my “day” <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__9c5e4a8de50f4ce487e67140f57c59fc__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/smile.png"><br><br>Due to various development complications and setbacks, Meower will NOT be releasing on Scratch, rather, it will be initially released independently from Scratch. This will serve as a feature test and for debugging purposes only. It will be called “Public Beta Test 1”. This should not be mistaken for Yoom, a fork of Meower.<br><br>Features that I will try to implement in the test are:<br><br>1. Basic messaging functionality<br>2. Account authentication/profile page management<br>3. Discussion thread storage/management<br><br>The build of Meower, excluding these implemented tests, will remain vanilla and (hopefully) ST-compliant.<br><br>Also, I've been very busy working with my dad in our garage to finish a car for one of our customers. We're very busy, and our garage currently has no internet access (it's a quarter-mile down a hill from my nearest internet access). Because of this, I haven't been able to work on meower as much as I'd like to. I will try to start Public Test 1 when I wake up around noon today, EDT. I'll be hosting a very crude CloudLink 3.0 server dedicated for Meower only. Don't expect much, and I doubt I can spin up a test server in time…</blockquote>Oh lol.
