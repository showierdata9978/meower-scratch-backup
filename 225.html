I suggest we stay small in the work of Meower until September, mainly making ideas and fixing old bugs. When more people are online, we can start to get back to work in bigger terms. This way, we won't get too much work done without the ones who want to contribute their ideas but cannot access the internet.</blockquote>That is true but:<br>People having been waiting on Meower for probably a year now. And the release dates that keep getting changed are really making people more anxious. If there is a entire 2 month extent people might get bored and even forget about Meower. The small 10 day extents are ok. But 2 months is too much. I don't make decisions of course but thats my opinion.</blockquote><br>I guess really. and yeah, I've been waiting on Meower for 3 years now. Thats as old as my account. </div><hr \><h3> meguy7878 </h3> <br/><div> sadly, more bugs to report… While in debugger mode, hovering over a part in the debug values mode will show what you are hovering over, right? but if you open the menu, the values will only show up for the buttons in the menu until the menu is closed. So basically, if you have the menu open, the project wont detect things like “SEARCH,” “DEBUG,” or “MAIN” and the other buttons. All except for the ones in the menu, “SETTINGS,” “PROFILE_SELF,” and “LOGOUT”<br><br>Since this a debugger bug, I would say that it is at a low rate that we need to fix it. But the big bug is that the chat phrase selector shows the number values instead of the words. We really need to finish that. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">meguy7878 wrote:</p>sadly, more bugs to report… While in debugger mode, hovering over a part in the debug values mode will show what you are hovering over, right? but if you open the menu, the values will only show up for the buttons in the menu until the menu is closed.

Because of how easy it is to fix, it's a very low priority bug. And the debugger menu is hardly used, so I might consider removing it all together.<br><br>2. The phrase selector is currently replaced with a placeholder script that shows the phrase db list. This is not a bug. I didn't have time last night to mess with the project enough to display human-readable text in that placeholder menu. This is only temporary to test the phrase database and not the phrase selector gui. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> now that I think about it, it wouldn't be too hard to add an autocorrect feature </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>now that I think about it, it wouldn't be too hard to add an autocorrect feature</blockquote>yeah </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> bump </div><hr \><a href="./227.html"> Next page </a>
