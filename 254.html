(besides one being TurboWarp and the other being HTML)</blockquote><br>…you're right about 50% of that.<br><br>Meower is (supposed to be on) Scratch, while Meower+ is written in HTML and JS from the ground up. Yoom, a fork of Meower, will use TurboWarp. As of now, Meower isn't mature enough for deployment on Scratch nor for forking. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">mccann119 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">-CloudGate- wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">DaCatBlock wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">mccann119 wrote:</p><span class="bb-bold">I want a PWA because I don't like going to this forum to get the link.

While we did try (and fail), proper account authentication should be a high priority. Also, we need to finish the following:<br><br>1. Getting Scratch cloud code working.<br>2. Adding a tutorial animation for new members.<br>3. Add a sprite-based GUI for slower devices.<br>4. Finishing our database of phrases for ST compliance.<br>5. Finish implementing features:<br> - Discussion forums<br> - Friends / Profiles / Search for people<br> - Post reputation system </div><hr \><h3> CST1229 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">mccann119 wrote:</p>I wanna know why I can't type in a post like in other networks.</blockquote>It's because if it was like that, it would be not allowed on Scratch. </div><hr \><h3> mccann119 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">CST1229 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">mccann119 wrote:</p>I wanna know why I can't type in a post like in other networks.</blockquote>It's because if it was like that, it would be not allowed on Scratch.</blockquote>It's not on Scratch.
