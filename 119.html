But if someone else hacks… That's not very good. But in the diagram he shows that if someone does find out how to hack that, it won't matter because filtration happens both before the message is sent and before it reaches the other person, so the other people will get the message filtered and it won't show up. Then the user will be tracked down and not only banned from Meower, but reported to Scratch itself for hacking.</blockquote>I don't know how to do it myself, because I go not know js or python,  but go ask in in advanced topics how to change cloud variables externally. They are smart. You can't just crash scratch like that. You would need to continuously change cloud variable in numerous projects which would take a lot of money to run(I think). The more feasible way is to actually hack it in a way the ST doesn't know about, but you have to be really smart. Changing cloud variables is an exploit that the ST knows about, but doesn't fix for some reason. </div><hr \><h3> MatteoBottorff </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">CST1229 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MatteoBottorff wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">CST1229 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">scratchCoolMic wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MatteoBottorff wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>.snip.<br>Ideally, we should deny access if TurboWarp is detected and suggest the user should use <span class="bb-underline"><span class="bb-bold">Yoom</span></span> instead or view the Meower project in Scratch.</blockquote>What is <span class="bb-underline"><span class="bb-bold">Yoom</span></span>?<br><br><pre class="blocks">when green flag clicked<br>ask [what is Yoom?] and wait</pre></blockquote>Ya, what is Yoom?</blockquote>Yoom stands for <span class="bb-underline">Y</span>our <span class="bb-underline">O</span>wn <span class="bb-underline">O</span>nline <span class="bb-underline">M</span>essenger and is Meower's sister project.
