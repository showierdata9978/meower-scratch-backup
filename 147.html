Some of us use it for free servers, others for its intended purpose.<br>btw, replit is the coding platform itself, not the containers (servers). those are called repls. </div><hr \><h3> NILL_GAMES10 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">trappist-1e wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">markverb1 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">trappist-1e wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">meguy7878 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">zedthehedgehog wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">meguy7878 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">zedthehedgehog wrote:</p>I could make the server using one of my older sister's old computers, however, I've asked a lot of from her in the past, and I think asking her for a whole computer isn't gonna sit well with her.</blockquote>lol.
