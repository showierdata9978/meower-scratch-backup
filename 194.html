IP address, while it can track a person, I don't know how is it going to be used on Scratch, and also, people do change or hide their IP address for privacy reasons, there's nothing illegal about that… as for Email, ok, but, how will we access it? Sharing Email isn't that bad, it's less convenient to spam, and scams do come in whether or not we share our email, just be careful as per normal. So, just someone enlighten me, why are we trying to track someone's IP on Scratch???

It was a rather stupid idea of mine and I was made well aware of just how dumb I was to suggest it.
