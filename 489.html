<h3> pizzafox20109 </h3> <br/><div> When Beta 5 releases, I will start yet another challenge, this time not using any other social media other than Meower, until February 10th. I'm doing this to see how easy it is to switch to Meower, and also cause I like using Meower lol </div><hr \><h3> meowy_fan </h3> <br/><div> I can't wait for Meower Beta 5!<br>Also for the admins: I was told that I might get banned from Meower. If this is true, please don't ban me. I thought I was being bullied which I wasn't, and I was being a complete baby for no good reason. The only reason I created a Scratch account was to experience more to Scratch then I have before I made my account. I have been on Scratch without a Scratch account for a while, and I had a Meower account, but no Scratch account. I thought joining Scratch would mean it would be more better, but me joining Scratch has put my Meower access privileges to risk. So if you are going to ban me for what I have been doing on Scratch and the Meower topic, please do not ban me. I never wanted to cause drama and offtopicness, but I mistakenly have. If you will proceed to ban me on Meower, I will understand, but I will be sad due to the fact that my Meower account was the only reason I decided to make a Scratch account. </div><hr \><h3> SpyderDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>It's the final countdown.
