The current logo has the regular font we use, but I think that the logo should reflect meower. just like how scratch's logo reflects it's playful, loose nature. </blockquote><br>I'm just gonna keep this as simple as it could possibly be: We couldn't come to an agreement on anything. So, we choose to make modifications to the MMC logo and say “One logo only.” Thankfully, this is our compromise we made, and we're going to try to stick to it as a team.<br><br>It's a 3-step rule we have made:<br><br><span class="bb-bold">1. Keep Meower's branding consistent.</span> We've been having an identity crisis: we had 2 separate logos for MMC and Meower. We decided to go with one uniform logo, with some modifications.<br><br><span class="bb-bold">2. Reflect Meower's graphical design elements</span> (specifically the iconic Meowy face).<br><br><span class="bb-bold">3. Keep the fonts uniform</span> to what you'll be seeing in the future in Meower.<br><br>Beta 5 is coming soon, and we chose Simvoni as it's font family. It's simple, clean, and works well, with some little things here and there you might notice upon closer inspection that it has room for play. The scratch font does have the more playful thing going for it, but it's terrible from a graphical design standpoint, and not to mention it just looks alien to the design language Meower uses. </div><hr \><h3> DaCatBlock </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>Wanna hear what we could do with that?<br><br>This might come as a shock, or even a crazy revelation!<br><br>Get ready, because it's about to blow your mind!<br><br>We could but it's not possible at this time.
