This excludes prebuilt phrases. I am working on the Display list, trying to make it show words you can <span class="bb-italic">actually</span> type (not just all the words that match in the system), however this might take a bit to solve. I imagine it could say, “you can add onto what you’re writing: a verb, noun…” like that.<br><br>LINK to latest version: <a href="https://turbowarp.org/606385807">https://turbowarp.org/606385807</a> you might notice the 1,000+ items in the Parameters list.
