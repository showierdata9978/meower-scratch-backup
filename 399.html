BlueList is structured so that you can either say one of the prebuilt phrases OR by putting together parts of speech (noun + verb, for example) so you COULD say “I ran” etc. You can’t say just anything, only the words that are approved. It’s really hard to have gigantic lists of words, but with a team of people it could be improved.<br><br><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Maclator wrote:</p>can punctuation work because I can type <blockquote>hello everyone</blockquote>but not <blockquote>hello everyone!</blockquote></blockquote><br>Right.
