If you contribute and state what you did, you will be credited. </div><hr \><h3> markverb1 </h3> <br/><div> i think i might be able to help with adding stuff to the phrasedb </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> After a long haul, the project has been updated to test drive the phrase selection system.<br><br>Because of the newly converted Phrase database, I will need to manually recompile the phrase categories (they will load a blank menu, which is utterly useless) In the meantime, I have implemented a placeholder selection screen. All options appear to be working thus far. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> Also, I should provide a little bit of spec on how we will be encoding/decoding messages.<br><br>When the user selects a phrase in the GUI, if the contents of the created phrase exist as an item within the phrase database, it will be allowed to be sent, and the phrase ID is assigned to a number in the phrase database.<br><br>We string together several of these IDs to create larger conversations. This effectively conserves bandwidth since we don't need to transmit individual chunks of a phrase, but rather, an association of said phrase.<br><br>As for items that contain the @(username) item, the very next item in the message will encode the username to @t. Here's an example of how this should work in the end:<br><br>WORDS list:<br><br>1. “Hello”<br>2. “World”<br>3. “!”<br>4. “.”<br>5. “@(username)”<br><br>PHRASE DB list:<br><br>1. “1;2;3;”<br>2. “1;2;4;”<br>3. “1;5;3;”<br><br>When the user inputs a phrase, they select words from the word list. Each item in the word list has an item number, which tells the PhraseDB what to reference. If a certain combination of words doesn't match any of the contents of the phrase DB, the item will not be added to the message or the message will be prevented from being transmitted.<br><br>Let's say that a user inputs “Hello”, “World”, and “!”, creating the phrase “Hello World!”. This phrase is encoded as “1;2;3;”. Since this exists within the phrase DB, it is allowed. And this item, existing within the DB, is item number 1.<br><br>When the user transmits the message, the full message is made as simple as just “1;”, representing the item number 1 in the DB, which will then decode into item “1;2;3” in the words list, which also gets decoded into “Hello World!”.<br><br>The trick here is that if a certain combination of words isn't within the predefined phrase database, the message will never be sent, and in the event that the message does send, the data would be corrupted and the users on the other end would never see the message, as it would automatically be detected as corrupt and deleted upon receiving.<br><br>Now, phrases that utilize the username tagger will simply add the username to @t right after the PhraseDB item number. Let's go over it.<br><br>1. User inputs “Hello”, “@(username)”, and “!”.<br><br>2. These words are encoded as “1;5;3;”, and this item exists within the phrase DB, which allows the message. This phrase is encoded as Phrase ID #3.<br><br>3. The user is asked what username to @t. They will only be permitted to select from an automatically updating list of online users. Let's say that the user selects “another_user”. <br><br>4. The user has essentially created the message “Hello another_user!”. This is ultimately encoded as “3;another_user”, which gets sent to everyone, but the message will mention the user, “another_user”.<br><br>5. Let's say that another_user gets the message. The project decodes the message “3;another_user” as Phrase #3, with the username tag set to “another_user”.<br><br>6. Phrase 3 is decoded as words 1, 5, and 3. Since the message specifies the value of the @(username) tag (word 5), that will be replaced with the value “another_username”.<br><br>7. The message “Hello another_username!” is verified and shown to another_user. </div><hr \><h3> Tycho112 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Tycho112 wrote:</p>hey nobody saw my post but can i still join?</blockquote><br>No need to apply.
