As of now, the only available jobs open are advertiser and playtester/debugger.

Our moderator role is full and we have 2 musicians right now, but I suppose it wouldn't hurt to add one more. At the moment, everyone's <span class="bb-italic">supposed</span> to be spreading the word that Meower is getting back on track, and nothing big will really happen until May 28 passes, so for the moment, all I need from you is to come up with a BGM for meower. One sound clip, and whatever the other two musicians compose I'll create a vote to see which one is best. So for now, try to make a BGM, and from there just relax. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <span class="bb-bold"><span class="bb-big"><span style="color:red">ATTENTION ALL MEMBERS/CONTRIBUTORS!!!</span></span></span><br><br>This is a friendly reminder that development on Meower will go full steam ahead on May 28. For now, here are the following roles/tasks we need to accomplish:<br><br><span class="bb-italic">ADVERTISERS:</span> Please spread the word about Meower in any way, shape, or form! (please don't spam people as that would be rude and ruin Meower's reputation)<br><br><span class="bb-italic">PROGRAMMERS/CLOUD/SERVERS:</span> Send links to demos about the cloud engine. We will need to thoroughly test it before our initial release.<br><br><span class="bb-italic">PLAYTESTERS/DEBUGGERS:</span> Please test demos sent from the programmers. I will also need testers to <a href="https://turbowarp.org/468221502?fps=60&amp;hqpen">check this demo</a> for any bugs (note that there is a high chance of such since I'm actively working on it, little by little).<br><br><span class="bb-italic">MUSICIANS/COMPOSERS:</span> Create AT LEAST ONE Background Music track for Meower. Our aesthetic I'd hope for us to achieve is similar to the Wii U System OST… <a href="/discuss/youtube/yL8H0eqrvcQ/">See this for reference of the vibe.</a> Send links to completed works prior to May 28 and we'll all have a vote on which track is the best. Winning BGM will serve as the default BGM for Meower.<br><br><span class="bb-italic">MODERATORS:</span> Please be on standby. Any other skills applicable (such as art, music, etc.) should be used to assist the aforementioned. If not applicable, simply relax. Currently, the only assistance needed from human moderators is to manage spam and/or handle bug reports, so feel free to compile a list of all possible cases that you can think of, and we'll create a FAQ for bug reports.<br><br><span class="bb-italic">DESIGNERS:</span> As mentioned for the Moderators, any skills applicable (such as art, music, etc.) should be used to assist others. For now, you don't have any other jobs to handle.<br><br><span class="bb-italic"><span class="bb-bold">FOR ALL MEMBERS:</span></span> To keep our project running, I'd like everyone to check in with the forum <span class="bb-bold"><span class="bb-underline">at least once a week</span></span>, simply posting something like “checking in”. I'd like to keep consistency with the attendance of members and keep track of activity. This rule will begin enforcement on April 30, 2021, at 12:00 PM EST.<br><br>As for myself, I will continue to manage the forums, (try to) work on the front end, and get the final OK from ST for any pending, serious questions.<br>Good luck everyone! I'll be here if you have questions/need help. Until May 28, everyone!  </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> <div class="code"><pre>-deleted by bloctans_4, please don't bump posts that have had messages in the previous 24 hours-</pre></div> </div><hr \><a href="/meower-scratch-backup/18.html"> Next page </a>
