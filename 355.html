Just because MEOWER is Scratch-related, it might not be legal for MEOWER to collect the same type of data Scratch does.

Second point, Nun of us have the money nor time to get a lawyer or legal advice, just saying!  Let me look into this, If MEOWER is careful, we can collect Level 2+ user data with a Agreement from a user. </div><hr \><a href="/meower-scratch-backup/356.html"> Next page </a>
