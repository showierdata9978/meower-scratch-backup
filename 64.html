Since we're close to revealing Meower, I might as well explain what's going to go down with Yoom.<br><br>TL;DR: Copy-paste BBCode+ Renderer + event handling code in Meower &amp; transfer it over to Yoom.<br><br>Fundamentally, Meower is a very fancy pen-and-stamp-based BBCode+ renderer. Once complete, it will have the bare bones of developing other apps using it's code. Yoom, as of now, is only a sprite-based GUI, with no rendering code. Meower's code is separated into 3 components, and that is a BBCode+ renderer, the event handler for BBCode+ input, and the rendering code for the Meower GUI. Basically, I'm removing the Meower GUI code, and moving over the BBCode+ renderer + event handling scripts and modifying them to work in Yoom. </div><hr \><a href="./66.html"> Next page </a>
