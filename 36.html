Please come back later.<br><br>Also… I've made an announcement a while back that I'm licensing Meower as open-source, public domain software under the Unlicensed license. Today, I officially announce to unlicense.org that Meower is in fact, FOSS (Sent the announcement to their google group). I'm not entirely sure how they will feel knowing a project written using Scratch is Unlicensed, but I feel that making the project FOSS will benefit everyone. The announcement as of 11:26 AM EDT is under approval, but I hope it gets added!<br><br> </div><hr \><h3> RykerJohnson </h3> <br/><div> I finished a couple of different ideas for meower background music, now I just need to choose one and make it a full track. </div><hr \><h3> bloctans_4 </h3> <br/><div> rules:<br>break these rules means a warn:<br>1.no spamming<br>mikedev can do the rest </div><hr \><h3> NILL_GAMES10 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">RykerJohnson wrote:</p>I finished a couple of different ideas for meower background music, now I just need to choose one and make it a full track.</blockquote>What software do you use? </div><hr \><h3> RykerJohnson </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">NILL_GAMES10 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">RykerJohnson wrote:</p>I finished a couple of different ideas for meower background music, now I just need to choose one and make it a full track.</blockquote>What software do you use?</blockquote>I use FL Studio Mobile on my PC (it's on the windows store).
