Now we have a super-computer made up of four LG OS thingys, but sadly I don't think we can use them. If anyone has a spare, old computer, they can use that. My dad uses our old pc as a server for apps and stuff (not his apps, other people who asked him)</blockquote>Ooh sounds cool<br>Im pretty sure my dad has servers in his office a county away<br></blockquote>Yeah I know someone with lots of servers but for the Meower team I'd recommend to find someone with servers who they really trust because letting some random person host their servers can lead to messages being altered or deleted or anything else they wouldn't want</blockquote><br>Yeah, thats really true. Mabey MikeDev should have hold with the servers? </div><hr \><h3> meguy7878 </h3> <br/><div> I think we will have to block use to Turbowarp with the “Is Compiled” block, because people can change their usernames, and I am 100% sure I will see someone change their username to griffpatch or MikeDev and say something =\ </div><hr \><h3> -CloudGate- </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">RoboStudiosGames wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">meguy7878 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">GuitarGuyPlayz wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">RoboStudiosGames wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">GuitarGuyPlayz wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">-CloudGate- wrote:</p>Do we have anyone willing to be a server.

Nobody could fully connect.</blockquote>If the servers communicate this wont be a problem</blockquote>ahem… HOW</blockquote><br>Servers can run together, like Scratch runs on multiple servers, we don't really need to worry about that. Many online games and websites use multiple servers for data, like accounts, money, points, or things like that. Meower will be perfectly fine with multiple servers.</blockquote>This is what I meant, I'm sure Meower's creators can find a way to have multiple servers running at once</blockquote>I could do that. servers could be assigned different topics or parts. it wouldn't be too hard. If you want to do a repl.it server then you have to have something that acts like a server. we'd have to remake the server code on a different coding language. </div><hr \><h3> CST1229 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">meguy7878 wrote:</p>I think we will have to block use to Turbowarp with the “Is Compiled” block, because people can change their usernames, and I am 100% sure I will see someone change their username to griffpatch or MikeDev and say something =\</blockquote>TurboWarp's cloud servers are separate from Scratch's and are temporary (and the team probably wouldn't host a server there).<br>Also, you can use “is TurboWarp?” to actually detect TurboWarp (is compiled is supposed to be for all stuff that compiles projects and reports false if the compiler is disabled). </div><hr \><h3> NILL_GAMES10 </h3> <br/><div> Is the servwr stuff gonna be in Python?<br><br>Im learning python rn </div><hr \><h3> zedthehedgehog </h3> <br/><div> I could make the server using one of my older sister's old computers, however, I've asked a lot from her in the past, and I think asking her for a whole computer isn't gonna sit well with her. </div><hr \><h3> meguy7878 </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">zedthehedgehog wrote:</p>I could make the server using one of my older sister's old computers, however, I've asked a lot of from her in the past, and I think asking her for a whole computer isn't gonna sit well with her.</blockquote>lol.
