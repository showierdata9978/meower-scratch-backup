<h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> Here's just a quick note for the current development state of Meower, as well as a few things I'd like to mention going forward in this collab thread.<br><br>1. If it wasn't obvious, I've been posting less and less, which is partially my fault, and I apologize. My last year of high school has been very demanding recently, and I've been running into the issue of having less and less time to work on Meower. If Scratch (or modded editors) supported multi-user editing functionality, I would've published a build by now and asked for more code help, but unfortunately, it's a very slow, linear, and monolithic development process. Turbowarp's customization features help, but this lack of real-time editing and reviewing functionality harms development time. Because of how much I've got on my hands, I find myself burning out quickly. I really love the Meower project, but this development nightmare is wearing me out.<br><br>2. Also, because of the new dependency upon CloudDisk, I would like to see who would be interested in being a whitehat hacker for a little while to do some security tests on the service prior to deployment. Simply let me know if you're interested and you will be provided with a CloudLink server URL to run brute-force tests on. CloudAccount authentication + session tokens are required for functionality, so that will also be an option to brute-force infiltration test on.<br><br>3. I've seen some suggestions on improving the chat system on Meower, and while I do like the idea of having a more “autocorrect”-Esque design I don't think the ST would like that sort. Let me know what you think beforehand for future improvements to the chat UI/UX.<br><br>4. I'm thinking of creating another version of Meower using Flask and CloudLink, but I also know that Meower+ is a thing, so I'd like to hear your feedback.<br><br>5. Speaking of projects like Meower+, any new development on our sister projects should be reported immediately here. I'd also like to talk about unifying server storage by using CloudDisk for Meower, Meower+, Yoom, etc.<br><br>6. I've heard no development on Woofer, so I'm going to assume the plugins project is dead. <br><br>7. While I do like people trying to keep the thread alive and active whilst I'm away at school or working on Meower, I'd really prefer if we were to stay on topic. If I were to create some sort of offtopic section for Meower, would you all like to use that? I really think that people are starting to get annoyed with constant off-topic updates from this thread.<br><br>8. Not only because of unanimous approval (and because I didn't really like making another purely text-based logo) Meower Media Co., will be going with @zedthehedgehog's logo. This change will be in effect after Beta 4.5 is published. But before implementation, I advise doing some finishing touches. Zed, if you can, please make the M in the logo more stylized to look like one of the meower cats, if not, let me know.<br><br>9. Meower is NOT dead, and no matter what anyone says about it, we must refuse to let them get to us<br><br>10. We have yet to determine whether or not it's safe to publish to native Scratch. It's still a risk since we're technically not fully approved by the ST. I really don't want to get the project killed because of some insignificant flaw, so we should start talking about this.  </div><hr \><h3> zedthehedgehog </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>8.

It seems like we need that at this point <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__9e38fe52d64ec7fb3f2d9001c5ce6660__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/tongue.png"> </div><hr \><h3> DaCatBlock </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>I really love the Meower project, but this development nightmare is wearing me out.<br></blockquote>Mike, just remember that your mental and physical health is far more important than this project. I understand the feeling you have, and it haunts you all the time. If you need to take a break, or leave entirely, you should. I’m not encouraging you to give up, but seriously: don’t ruin your experiences on scratch by trying to fill the shoes of 10 people.
