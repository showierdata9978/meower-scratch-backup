You will probably want to use this method when you put it into the actual project because it sounds much better than the single audio file. It is only broken into four tracks, so still pretty manageable. You could just use a custom block called “Play Music” or something and then put those four tracks inside the custom block so it's still like using a single “start sound” or “play until done” block. </div><hr \><h3> zedthehedgehog </h3> <br/><div> I pretty accurately traced the full funky cat png to vector.<br><br><a href="https://www.zedthenet.tk/fileshare/funkycat.svg">https://www.zedthenet.tk/fileshare/funkycat.svg</a> </div><hr \><h3> MrCreeperFX </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">zedthehedgehog wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MrCreeperFX wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">yooit_32 wrote:</p><blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">zedthehedgehog wrote:</p>However, which account are we talking about?
