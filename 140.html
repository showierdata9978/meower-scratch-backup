I refuse to let so. I'm not able to work on it since I don't have time on my hands at the moment. I provided plenty of documentation within the GUI code that should help out the programmers finish the remainder of the project (arguably the GUI was the hardest coding project I've ever done), however if there is a need for more documentation please send me a message on my profile and I'll check up on it every so often.<br><br>As a warning, please don't spam the forum. Let's try to stay focused. Also, let's not end up as another dead collab… </div><hr \><a href="./142.html"> Next page </a>
