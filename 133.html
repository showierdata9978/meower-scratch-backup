That also includes new Scratchers… As far as I know, there's not really a way to prevent this because there's no way to authenticate cloud requests.</blockquote>There isn't a way to, so we can't quite control what is being randomly put in the database, but what we can do is make sure that messages against the community guidelines are not displayed. That can be done by keeping a local copy of all the permitted combinations and checking if the combinations match. Also, I was thinking, since we already have such a list, why not the cloud only store which item on the combination list it is? That way, even if our database got edited, no matter what they input, it will end up displaying a permitted combination.</blockquote>Well yeah, that's all you can do, but it's something to keep in mind. </div><hr \><h3> -CloudGate- </h3> <br/><div> status update: cloud sprites added to main project. reading GUI code to understand how to make the system recognise a user as a server and do server stuff rather than user stuffs.

(Unless this is only for the text transmitting, which I assume is already being done (and Meower's cloud stuff uses a server)) </div><hr \><a href="/meower-scratch-backup/134.html"> Next page </a>
