It would of course be a little different for this, but same basic idea. The problem is, on an unnamed external platform people told me that would be considered free-chat? Not sure if this is true, but may be worth looking into. </div><hr \><h3> BlockPoint </h3> <br/><div> I would suggest removing any phrases with “I don't care.” Those can sometimes be offensive or insulting.
