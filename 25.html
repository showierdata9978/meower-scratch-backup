I've already got a few of my close friends interested. Developing Yoom will be easier since I don't have to worry about the ST, CGs, or technical limitations. Meower will take a little longer as we'll be working with managing the safety and security of the platform while developing it to run on Scratch cloud variable infrastructure. Once I Finish Yoom, all I need to do is modify it and share the finished GUI on Scratch, from which we'll connect the cloud code, add a suitable post creation interface, and perform final testing. </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">RykerJohnson wrote:</p>I got followed by World_Languages which is pretty cool, on a more important note I am currently working on the background music.</blockquote><br>Nice </div><hr \><a href="/meower-scratch-backup/27.html"> Next page </a>
