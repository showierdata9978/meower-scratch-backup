(please don't spam people as that would be rude and ruin Meower's reputation)<br><br><span class="bb-italic">PROGRAMMERS/CLOUD/SERVERS:</span> Send links to demos about the cloud engine.

Any other skills applicable (such as art, music, etc.) should be used to assist the aforementioned. If not applicable, simply relax. Currently, the only assistance needed from human moderators is to manage spam and/or handle bug reports, so feel free to compile a list of all possible cases that you can think of, and we'll create a FAQ for bug reports.<br><br><span class="bb-italic">DESIGNERS:</span> As mentioned for the Moderators, any skills applicable (such as art, music, etc.) should be used to assist others. For now, you don't have any other jobs to handle.<br><br><span class="bb-italic"><span class="bb-bold">FOR ALL MEMBERS:</span></span> To keep our project running, I'd like everyone to check in with the forum <span class="bb-bold"><span class="bb-underline">at least once a week</span></span>, simply posting something like “checking in”. I'd like to keep consistency with the attendance of members and keep track of activity. This rule will begin enforcement on April 30, 2021, at 12:00 PM EST.<br><br>As for myself, I will continue to manage the forums, (try to) work on the front end, and get the final OK from ST for any pending, serious questions.<br>Good luck everyone!

The latest build will be forked and converted into Yoom, and we will remove CloudLink in favor of Scratch's cloud variables to finish Meower.<br><br>For those not aware, Yoom is a project I created before the conception of Meower. Yoom was created in the early days of the Scratch 3.0 era, before the ban on whitelist-based chats. Development was put on hiatus when the new rules on cloud variables were announced. Then Meower came along. Long story short, Yoom is now Meower's sister project and will serve as a testing ground for new, experimental features (Including, but not limited to, custom user profile photos), as well as reviving the much-preferred whitelist-based chat system. I plan on continuing the development of both projects equally.<br><br><span class="bb-italic">(rEMoVED bY MoDERaTOR: We DoNT LiKE mEoWEr)</span><br></blockquote></li><li>November 11, 2021: Some updates!<blockquote>1. I fixed some things related to CloudLink so Meower should now have a more sane login prompt.<br>2. I just started implementing of CloudDisk! But, I still have to finish CloudDisk, but I will simultaneously develop Meower alongside CD.<br>3. I'm considering importing some components of Yoom's GUI to improve Meower's GUI in the future. Let me know what you guys think about it.<br>4. If I were to stream my development process via a link on my (nono word) status, would you guys watch it?<br><br>And… for the news you all have been loathing.<br><br>I have concluded that publishing Meower on Scratch is too risky, so as soon as Beta 4.5 is complete, we will no longer be publishing builds of Meower on Scratch, indefinitely. We will be moving all development and releases onto Github or other self-managed solutions. There are too many issues going on with Scratch's management and I don't want Meower to get the ax by someone else's hands.<br><br>We will never give up! See you all soon.</blockquote></li></ul></blockquote> </div><hr \><h3> trappist-1e </h3> <br/><div> Hello. I saw in the last post on the other forum that you need advertisers.
