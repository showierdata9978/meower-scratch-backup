We are proud to announce that Meower is being hosted over the Cloudflare network! This will hopefully improve the overall website experience and help  protect Meower from attacks. It also makes our lives easier as the team can simply push to Github and instantly get our webpages updated!<br><br>2. Meower itself will now live at app.meower.org, and meower.org/Meower will redirect to the aforementioned. Should help those not accustomed to touch typing.<br><br>3. We have a work-in-progress REST API in the works! You can check it out at api.meower.org! As of now it can only trace your IP (see api.meower.org/ip), but in the future this will open up a new realm of possibilities for meower-powered chat clients!<br><br>That's all for now, stay tuned for more!

This would work better with our “old” layout design in the upcoming Meower Beta. Thank you for your suggestions!<br><br>Also, a note for everyone: we are reimplementing the scrollbar, so the two buttons will be modified a bit for the scrollbar. If you didn't know, the current rendering engine is not friendly to the sorts, thankfully it's not the case with the upcoming beta. Stay tuned for more info about the upcoming Beta 5!<br> </div><hr \><h3> 101Corp </h3> <br/><div> Can I get a more detailed explnatin how to start a server and run Meowqer 5? </div><hr \><a href="./446.html"> Next page </a>
