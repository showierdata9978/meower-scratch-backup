I've programmed sound events for the main menu, user menu, and settings (which is the only one that has actual functionality). <br><br>Also, I like it! However, the synth that starts in the very beginning sounds a tad shallow (To my ears, it sounds like it's in a plastic box 10 feet away), if possible could you use something of higher fidelity? Other than that looping synth it's pretty good! </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">silvxrcat wrote:</p>can there be such thing as an Admin rank for you and me?

Simply make that modified looping synth around 5% quieter and it's perfect for a full-team review. </div><hr \><h3> GlitchedExe </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p><span class="bb-bold"><span class="bb-big"><span style="color:red">ATTENTION ALL MEMBERS/CONTRIBUTORS!!!</span></span></span><br><br>This is a friendly reminder that development on Meower will go full steam ahead on May 28.
