For that I need someone who knows how to code(not in scratch) and can make the server compatible with the scratch side. I can help whoever wants to make it by explaining how the server works since I don't know other coding languages. I will be adding some code that can send info to the server, but i need someone to copy the scratch code and make it on repl.

I know a lot of lua though, and HTML. Idk what language the server will use </div><hr \><a href="/?p=160"> Next page </a>
