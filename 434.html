Ahh, Scratch. Can’t live with it, can’t live without it. Honestly, my point of view is that the team has put so much work into this <span class="bb-italic">thing</span> and allllllll that hard work would just go to waste following the guidelines. Unless we could come up with a clever tactic for a better chat system, why waste it. I tried very hard to find a solution, but it’s just not possible <img src="//cdn.scratch.mit.edu/scratchr2/static/__2c73790179250ee448875047b690f824__/djangobb_forum/img/smilies/neutral.png"></blockquote>@Pixelation-Creations, both DabCatBlock and I have tried to build something like this but either Scratch crashes, ST gets mad, or it is not usable. You are right, there are a billion chat platforms and GitHub, but few are about scratch and Meower has gained 40k views on this forum. I would say knock yourself out but you're basically asking for everyone contributed, INCLUDING mikedev who has spent hours on it to pivot our work completely and try to build up again.</blockquote>no i am just basically saying that we should have a version on scratch, following the scratch guidelines, not reworking meower, because i get that a lot of hours and effort have been put in by mikedev and the team, but we should make at least part of it what it originaly was </div><hr \><h3> DaCatBlock </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">Pixelation-Creations wrote:</p>no i am just basically saying that we should have a version on scratch, following the scratch guidelines, not reworking meower, because i get that a lot of hours and effort have been put in by mikedev and the team, but we should make at least part of it what it originaly was</blockquote>I don’t think that’s a great idea.
