Please don't feel bad about your submission if I didn't like it. I'm just being honest and telling the truth here…<br><br>I like BGM 4 since it can be repurposed in many ways. One part could be used for the setup theme. Another would be for browsing the global chatroom. All together would be the home page, etc. BGM 1 is also another top pick, though I feel like it would be fitting to use it as a theme for interacting in group chats. BGM 3 is good for setup. 2 is a tad bit repetitive and shallow in my opinion.<br><br>Mascot 4 is cute, that's all I need to say. If we're thinking logically, my second pick for mascot is 1, since it reminds me of AOL Messenger, which is part of a category of software that Meower should be known for. 5 is a tad bit unoriginal, including 3 (even I don't like my own creations at times). 2 is not professional enough IMO, and it vaguely reminds me of ToonTown Online, which I wouldn't prefer Meower being associated with… </div><hr \><h3> zedthehedgehog </h3> <br/><div> Mascot 5 was actually supposed to be a joke btw </div><hr \><h3> MikeDEV </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">zedthehedgehog wrote:</p>Mascot 5 was actually supposed to be a joke btw</blockquote><br>…well then </div><hr \><h3> zedthehedgehog </h3> <br/><div> <a href="https://cubeupload.com/im/zedthehedgehog/MeowyandMeowy13.png"><img src="https://u.cubeupload.com/zedthehedgehog/MeowyandMeowy13.png"></a><br><br>An improved version of the 4th one<br><br>I personally thought the ears and eyes were too small </div><hr \><h3> BertieBoy </h3> <br/><div> <blockquote><p class="bb-quote-author">MikeDEV wrote:</p>VOTING FORM:<br><blockquote><span class="bb-bold">What BGM do you like?: </span> (1 and 4)<br><span class="bb-bold">What mascot do you like?:</span> (4)</blockquote></blockquote> </div><hr \><a href="/meower-scratch-backup/50.html"> Next page </a>
