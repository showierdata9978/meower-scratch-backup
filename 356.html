We will explicitly ask for permission to store data to make the service work (GDPR, Meower's ToS/PP Consent Screen prior to Account Creation)<br>2. We will offer the rights to our users' data and must provide services to manage that data (GDPR)<br>3. We cannot collect personally identifying information or track our users over the internet, especially minors (Pretty much common sense, also COPPA)<br>4. For minors, we will ask for permission from parents to use the service (COPPA)<br>5. We will remain transparent, FOSS, and privacy-friendly as possible (Play nice)<br>6. We will comply with local legislation (Since I own and manage Meower Media Co, and operate within the US, we will comply with the laws in the US)<br>7. We cannot discriminate any communication, but we are to moderate communications to keep our service friendly to all<br>8. In the event that policies are revised, we are to notify users and obtain consent to continue using the services<br><br>(TBH, getting a legal team sooner than later sound like a better idea to me now: I'm starting to get really, really tired of dealing with legalities…) </div><hr \><a href="/358.html"> Next page </a>
